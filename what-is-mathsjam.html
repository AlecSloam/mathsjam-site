<p><strong>MathsJam</strong> is a monthly opportunity for like-minded self-confessed maths enthusiasts to get together in a pub and share stuff they like. Puzzles, games, problems, or just anything they think is cool or interesting. We don't have organised talks, planned activities or even strict timings - just turn up and join in.</p>

<p>
  We meet on the second to last Tuesday of every month, from 7pm or 7.30pm in the evening. Events happen simultaneously (where possible) in locations all over the world. For more details of local events, use the menu to navigate. 
  You can follow our activity by looking at the <a href="http://www.twitter.com/mathsjam">@MathsJam</a> twitter feed.
