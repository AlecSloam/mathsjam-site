<p><strong>MathsJam</strong> is a monthly opportunity for like-minded self-confessed maths enthusiasts to get together in a pub and share stuff they like. Puzzles, games, problems, or just anything they think is cool or interesting. We don't have organised talks, planned activities or even strict timings - just turn up and join in.</p>

<p>
  We meet on the second to last Tuesday of every month, from 7pm or 7.30pm in the evening. Events happen simultaneously (where possible) in locations all over the world. For more details of local events, use the menu to navigate. 
  You can follow our activity by looking at the <a href="http://www.twitter.com/mathsjam">@MathsJam</a> twitter feed.

  <b>MathsJam is not for children</b>. MathsJam is an event for adults to meet and socialise, which is why they are mainly held in licensed premises, where under-18s are not allowed. Do let us know via <a href="mailto:katie@mathsjam.com">katie@mathsjam.com</a> if you come across an event for children being called "MathsJam", or you see MathsJam being promoted to young students.
</p>

<p>
  MathsJam also runs an <strong>annual gathering</strong> which takes place every November, and in 2016 was on <strong>12<sup>th</sup>-13<sup>th</sup> November</strong>. 
  More information about the gatherings can be found <a href="{{site.url}}gathering">on the gathering pages</a>.
