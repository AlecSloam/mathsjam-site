<p><strong>MathsJam</strong> is a monthly opportunity for like-minded self-confessed maths enthusiasts to get together in a pub and share stuff they like. Puzzles, games, problems, or just anything they think is cool or interesting.</p>

<p>
  We meet on the second to last Tuesday of every month, from 7pm in the evening. Events happen simultaneously in locations around the UK (and the world!)
