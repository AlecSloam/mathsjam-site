This is a list of talks given at the 2017 MathsJam Weekend, along with a brief description and slides where we have them.


## Saturday
### Session 1a: 14:00 - 14:47

#### Colin Wright, Matt Parker and Katie Steckles: Welcome to the MathsJam Gathering

#### Tom Button: All about the base (no trebles)

You might have heard that the square of a prime number (p>3) is always one more than a multiple of 24. [Tom](http://twitter.com/tombutton) introduced the words threven, thover and thrunder for numbers of the form 3n, 3n + 1 and 3n - 1 respectively, and moved into dozenal, and suddenly the proof was easy.

<!--
How introducing a change of base and some new terminology can make the proof of an interesting result a bit more straightforward.

#### Matt Peperell: Logical deducation games

Logical deduction games are those like [Penultima](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/118656/penultima) where players have to deduce to rules by being told when they've broken them.

[Matt](http://twitter.com/mattpep) showed us a few of them, including Zendo, Mao and [Eleusis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eleusis_%28card_game%29) which you can play with an incomplete deck of cards. 

#### Alison Kiddle: Alison talks crap

Having seen the classic "Andrex paper: 22.2p per 100sht" tweet, Alison has gathered data about how the statistic differs depending on how you expand the abbreviaton "sht" and how healthy you are, and presented her findings to us. She also delivers a fine array of puns which for various reasons will not be reproduced here.

#### TD Dang: The maths in Mean Girls

[TD](twitter.com/televisionduck) has watched _Mean Girls_ which features a maths competition in the finale. She's put a lot of thought into not only how to approach the questions in it, but also how the wrong answers might have been arrived at.

#### Noel-Ann Bradshaw: Digesting the indigestible

Noel-Ann has also got a talk about data and how to present it. (There is no literal digestion in this data talk.) A highlight was her taking apart the commonly held idea that the y-axis must always include zero to stop a graph being misleading by showing examples where thta clearly makes no sense.



### Session 1b: 15:10 - 15:57

#### Zoe Griffiths: A discourse on e

[Zoe](https://twitter.com/zoelgriffiths) impresively recites from memory a humerous poem she wrote about the [base of the natural logarithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E_(mathematical_constant)) which told of the life of e.

#### Phil Chaffe: Maths Jammin' - Writing a song for the Maths Jam Jam

[Phil](https://twitter.com/philsmaths) gives us five tips on how to write a MathsJam song, in attempt to increase the number of entries for next year. So go on and give it a go!

#### Matthew Scroggs: Big Ben Strikes Again

[Matt](http://mscroggs.co.uk/) ([Twitter](https://twitter.com/mscroggs)) explains how in the [Captain Scarlett](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_Scarlett) episode "Big Ben Strikes Again", Captain Blue used real maths to calculate the location of a ~~bomb~~ civil device by correlating the rings of Big Ben he heard on Radio 4 with the rings he could hear from the clock itself.

#### Andrew Russell: Diabolo as a picture

After deciding that Diablo knots are too complicated to understand, Andrew shows us how every balloon animal should be a [semi-Eulerian](http://mathonline.wikidot.com/eulerian-graphs-and-semi-eulerian-graphs#toc3) graph, but sometimes isn't.

#### Angela Brett: Mathematical poetry

[Angela](angelastic.com) recites a poem about how progress is made by standing on the shoulders of not only giants but a lot of shorter people too, and then shows us some Haiku that she discovered in mathematical texts using her own [Haiku detector](https://spondeesoftware.wordpress.com/apps/haiku-detector) software.

#### Adam Townsend: Stop! (or, using maths to pass your driving test)

[Adam](adamtounsend.com) ([Twitter](https://twitter.com/pecnut)) avoids memorising stopping distances for his driving test by learning the equation instead, with justification from mechanics. Turns out the units you choose have a big impact on how memorable the formula is. Also, British people seem to believe that they have much faster reactions than citizens of any other country.

#### Elizabeth and Zeke: rat with an e

[Elizabeth (and Zeke)](https://twitter.com/RealityMinus3) talk (well, Zeke didn't talk) about tangent lines, what we should call them, and some flashes of intuition about what logarithms mean from a student with a different perspective.
