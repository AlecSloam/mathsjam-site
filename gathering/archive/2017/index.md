This is a list of talks given at the 2017 MathsJam Weekend, along with a brief description and slides where we have them.

## Saturday
### Session 1a: 14:00 - 14:47

#### Colin Wright, Matt Parker and Katie Steckles: Welcome to the MathsJam Gathering

#### Tom Button: All about the base (no trebles)

You might have heard that the square of a prime number (p>3) is always one more than a multiple of 24. [Tom](http://twitter.com/tombutton) introduced the words threven, thover and thrunder for numbers of the form 3n, 3n + 1 and 3n - 1 respectively, and moved into dozenal, and suddenly the proof was easy.

<!--
How introducing a change of base and some new terminology can make the proof of an interesting result a bit more straightforward.

#### Matt Peperell: Logical deducation games

Logical deduction games are those like [Penultima](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/118656/penultima) where players have to deduce to rules by being told when they've broken them.

[Matt](http://twitter.com/mattpep) showed us a few of them, including Zendo, Mao and [Eleusis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eleusis_%28card_game%29) which you can play with an incomplete deck of cards. 

#### Alison Kiddle: Alison talks crap

Having seen the classic "Andrex paper: 22.2p per 100sht" tweet, Alison has gathered data about how the statistic differs depending on how you expand the abbreviaton "sht" and how healthy you are, and presented her findings to us. She also delivers a fine array of puns which for various reasons will not be reproduced here.

#### TD Dang: The maths in Mean Girls

[TD](twitter.com/televisionduck) has watched _Mean Girls_ which features a maths competition in the finale. She's put a lot of thought into not only how to approach the questions in it, but also how the wrong answers might have been arrived at.

#### Noel-Ann Bradshaw: Digesting the indigestible

Noel-Ann has also got a talk about data and how to present it. (There is no literal digestion in this data talk.) A highlight was her taking apart the commonly held idea that the y-axis must always include zero to stop a graph being misleading, by showing examples where that clearly makes no sense.

### Session 1b: 15:10 - 15:57

#### Zoe Griffiths: A discourse on e

[Zoe](https://twitter.com/zoelgriffiths) impresively recites from memory a humorous poem she wrote about the [base of the natural logarithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E_(mathematical_constant)) which told of the life of e.

#### Phil Chaffe: Maths Jammin' - Writing a song for the Maths Jam Jam

[Phil](https://twitter.com/philsmaths) gives us five tips on how to write a MathsJam song, in attempt to increase the number of entries for next year. So go on and give it a go!

#### Matthew Scroggs: Big Ben Strikes Again

[Matt](http://mscroggs.co.uk/) ([Twitter](https://twitter.com/mscroggs)) explains how in the [Captain Scarlet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_Scarlett) episode "Big Ben Strikes Again", Captain Blue used real maths to calculate the location of a ~~bomb~~ civil device by correlating the rings of Big Ben he heard on Radio 4 with the rings he could hear from the clock itself.

#### Andrew Russell: Diabolo as a picture

After deciding that Diablo knots are too complicated to understand, Andrew shows us how every balloon animal should be a [semi-Eulerian](http://mathonline.wikidot.com/eulerian-graphs-and-semi-eulerian-graphs#toc3) graph, but sometimes isn't.

#### Angela Brett: Mathematical poetry

[Angela](angelastic.com) recites a poem about how progress is made by standing on the shoulders of not only giants but a lot of shorter people too, and then shows us some Haiku that she discovered in mathematical texts using her own [Haiku detector](https://spondeesoftware.wordpress.com/apps/haiku-detector) software.

#### Adam Townsend: Stop! (or, using maths to pass your driving test)

[Adam](adamtownsend.com) ([Twitter](https://twitter.com/pecnut)) avoids memorising stopping distances for his driving test by learning the equation instead, with justification from mechanics. Turns out the units you choose have a big impact on how memorable the formula is. Also, British people seem to believe that they have much faster reactions than citizens of any other country.

#### Elizabeth and Zeke: rat with an e

[Elizabeth (and Zeke)](https://twitter.com/RealityMinus3) talk (well, Zeke didn't talk) about tangent lines, what we should call them, and some flashes of intuition about what logarithms mean from a student with a different perspective.

### Session 1c: 16:20 - 17:07

#### Rob Eastaway: Thinking Outside the Outside of the Box

Rob presents some twists on an old classic puzzle - given a 3 by 3 square of dots, can you connect them all using four straight lines without taking your pen off the paper? He's extended it to 4 by 4 versions, and shows that there are plenty of possible solutions - some of which require thinking up to 133% outside the box...

[Rob's tweet from earlier in the day](https://twitter.com/robeastaway/status/929297289746812929)

#### Rachel Wright: In A Spin

Rachel is interested in yarn, and showed us how the way spinning machines produce it - and an interesting topological puzzle it presented.

[Rachel's textile art](http://rachelwright.com/)
[Rachel's book on yarn manufacture](https://books.google.co.uk/books/about/Fancy_Yarns.html?id=wFy3zyvjMNUC&redir_esc=y)

#### Alex Burlton: Bags of Palindromes

A palindromic number is one whose digits read the same backwards as forwards. Given a random collection of numbers, what's the probability you can arrange them into a palindrome, and how does this change as the number of possible digits changes?

#### Alexander Bolton: Winning the Chalkdust Coin Game

Alex describes a strategy for winning a game that involves flipping a number of coins, and using the number of heads and tails to determine your score.

[Alex's article about the game for Chalkdust Magazine](http://chalkdustmagazine.com/blog/winning-chalkdust-coin-game/)

#### Vincent Van Pelt: Thank you, Mrs Holcombe

Vincent has been investigating homophones - words which sound the same as each other. He's found quite an impressive list (the best one was 'Grothendieck K-Theory' which sounds like 'Growth and decay theory'.

### Session 1d: 17:30 - 18:17

#### Dan Hagon: Double Negation and the Excluded Middle

[Dan](https://twitter.com/axiomsofchoice) talks about how asserting something is not the same as asserting the double negation of that thing, and how this can affect proofs by contradiction.

#### Ben Pace: Building Successful Intellectual Communities

Ben talks about the maths behind the PageRank algorithm, and how it can be applied towards trustworthiness scoring on social sharing sites.

#### Alison Clarke: Stupid Units

[Alison](https://twitter.com/aaclarke4) vents some frustration about numerous unit systems that make very little sense, and tells us a bit about how they came to be. Why is an acre not a square?

#### Belgin Seymenoglu: Donald in Mathmagic Land

[Belgin](https://twitter.com/smokyfurby) shows us where some mathematical concepts from _Donald in Mathmagic Land_ appear in the real world.

#### Douglas Buchanan: Lowering the Tone

[Douglas](https://twitter.com/dcbeagle1) gives us a puzzle and a pun:

"You are given 4 values. Using only the four simple operators, make 24. The four values are 3, 3, 8, and 8."

"I have fifteen parrots in a cage with three perches. When I clap, six parrots land at the bottom, five in the middle, and four at the top. How many do I own?"

<small>*(six, the others are on higher perches)*</small>

#### David Mitchell: The Thereom of Trythagoras (Pythagoras is for Squares)

David shows us a fascinating explanation of how you can multiply squares and triangles on the complex plane to find pythagorean triples and more.

#### Dave Gale: Catchphrase and Coffee

[Dave](https://twitter.com/reflectivemaths) presents some confusing coffee scales, and his increasingly formal correspondence with ITV over a misnamed quadrilateral in _Catchphrase_.

## Sunday
### Session 2a: 08:50 - 09:37

#### Joel Haddley: Angle Trisection

[Joel](https://twitter.com/joelhaddley) shows us how to trisect angles in an infinite number of steps, although isn't sure if you can do this in a finite amount of time.

#### Katie Steckles: Sheeran Numbers

[Katie](https://twitter.com/stecks) makes 22262 different numbers using number one albums as numbers and Ed Sheeran albums as operators.

#### Ken McKelvie: A little ado about 'nothing'

Ken talks about where 0 appears in lots of numbers.

#### Tony Mann: The mathematics of competition

[Tony](https://twitter.com/Tony_Mann) finds yet another meaning of competition, and explains how having more ice cream vendors doesn't mean you have to walk less far to get an ice cream: or how two competition competitions in competitions should place themselves to each maximise the number of competitions entered in their competition competition.

#### Will Kirkby: Life beyond binary

[Will](https://twitter.com/WillKirkby) uses a trinary celluar automaton to sort binary numbers, then asks if you can use a (n+1)-ary celluar automaton to sort n-ary numbers, then shows us lots of excellent other cellular automata.

#### Peter Rowlett: Fermi problems

(Peter)[https://twitter.com/peterrowlett] uses Fermi problems to justify the definition and use of the approximate geometric mean.

#### Kathryn Taylor: Adventures in modular origami

Kathryn uses the visualiser to show us some incredible incredible origami shapes built from Sonobe modules.
