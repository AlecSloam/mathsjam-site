<h3>Session 1</h3>

<div class="talk">
    <h4>Why teens want to learn maths - Jeremy Renals</h4>
    <p>Jeremy discusses the idea of teaching mathematics to teenagers, and the challenges this presents - inspired by a TED talk, which says to give students autonomy, mastery and purpose.</p>

<div class="talk">
    <h4>How To Improve Your A Level Results - Phil Harvey</h4>
    <p>Phil tells us about Simpson's Paradox - by analysing different subsets of a dataset, you can alter the statistical conclusions and make your results appear to go up, even if they go down when you look at the full data set! Phil discusses A Level results and cricket scores.</p>

    <h4>The Game That Plays Itself - Clare Sudbury</h4>
    <p>Clare tells us about the card game Beggar-My-Neighbour, in which each player's next move is dictated by the cards just played.
