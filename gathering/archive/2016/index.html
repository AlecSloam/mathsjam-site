<h2>More Detailed Abstracts</h2>
<p>These are in the order talks were proposed, so you may need to use a search function to find the one you're looking for.</p>
<div class="talk">
<h4>Checkboards, Euler, and non-crossing paths - Colin Wright</h4>
</div>
<div class="talk">
<h4>Constructions with Obstructions - Colin Wright</h4>
</div>
<div class="talk">
<h4>Everything Old is New Again, Again - Adam Atkinson</h4>
<div class="abstract">There are certain problems/stories/jokes which should be part of the shared cultural heritage of etc. etc. But if we all assume we all know these stories etc., people risk falling through the cracks. And that would never do. As a public service I shall just make sure that one of the stories that should be universally known is, at least among MathsJam attendees. 2 years ago: the right angle proof. This year, something equally vital. I only learned recently that our own Matt and Katie didn't know it, and can only blame myself.</div></div>
<div class="talk">
<h4>2A: A clever horse - theory and applications - Christian Lawson-Perfect</h4>
<div class="abstract">In short, I taught a tiny horse to count.</div></div>
<div class="talk">
<h4>Things to do with chains - Adam Atkinson</h4>
<div class="abstract">I went to a talk about chains in 1984. It was about a problem I've not run into since and might be of interest.</div></div>
<div class="talk">
<h4>Pillow Problem 49 and a cube of cheese - Noel France</h4>
</div>
<div class="talk">
<h4>Factorising A Large Semiprime When The Person Who Supplied It Has Been A Bit Careless - Phil Ramsden</h4>
<div class="abstract">At Imperial, I run the First Year Mathematical Computation course. Each year, there's a coursework task on RSA ciphers, which involves using my public key to send messages, and making one of your own to receive them. If you can factorise my N, you get 100%, even if you get everything else wrong. But there's a catch: if I factorise yours, you pay a 5% penalty.  I'm not a cryptanalyst or a number theorist, and I don't own a supercomputer. I have no more than a few minutes to spend attacking any one student's N. But I'm sneaky, and I have a few tricks up my sleeve. Just between ourselves, I'd like to share a few of them.</div></div>
<div class="talk">
<h4>How Many Pizzas? - Joel Haddley</h4>
<div class="abstract">Monohedral disk tilings, like pizzas, come in many flavours. Some flavours allow for retilings with interesting combinatorial properties.</div></div>

<div class="talk">
<h4>More than one way to skin a cat - Alison Kiddle</h4>
<div class="abstract">I spend much of my time thinking about how students solve problems, and how to help them become better problem solvers. I will share a couple of problems and invite you to find at least one way to solve them. No cats will be harmed.</div></div>
<div class="talk">
<h4>Three Compartment Modelling in Distribution of Drug - Ratnesh</h4>
<div class="abstract">For physicians renal diseases has been a cause of concern since a very long time.</div></div>
<div class="talk">
<h4>MENACE - Matthew Scroggs</h4>
<div class="abstract">In 1961, Donald Michie build MENACE (the Machine Educable Noughts And Crosses Engine), a machine built from matchboxes and beads that was able to learn how to play noughts and crosses. In this talk I will explain how it is possible to make matchboxes learn and I will show off the copy of Michie's machine that I have built.</div></div>
<div class="talk">
<h4>Mathematical Toddler Toys - Peter Rowlett</h4>
</div>
<div class="talk">
<h4>What is real? - Tarim</h4>
<div class="abstract">Real numbers lead to some interesting, and somewhat counter-intuitive, ideas.  An attempt to show that real numbers may have less to do with reality than you thought.</div></div>
<div class="talk">
<h4>Matt talks about a thing - Matt Parker</h4>
<div class="abstract">Matt Parker will talk about a thing he found on the 8 April 2016, which has the SHA-1 hash 475301fd3b5d2ba37ebb6be33f5376d7529a3f67</div></div>
<div class="talk">
<h4>More effective strategies for experimenting - Martin Owen</h4>

<div class="talk">
<h4>Some bit of interesting maths unearthed from somewhere - Liz</h4>
<div class="abstract">In a break from tradition I shall attempt to find an interesting bit of maths that has been dug up from somewhere that is not Egyptian. It's bound to prove that abstract maths has been interesting people since they needed to count the rocks they were banging together.</div></div>
<div class="talk">
<h4>My current favourite number - Colin Beveridge</h4>
</div>
<div class="talk">
<h4>Going round in circles... - Kathy Cohen</h4>
<div class="abstract">Taking a familair sequence and applying modulo arithmetic produces interesting results.</div></div>
<div class="talk">
<h4>Bills of Mortality - Martyn Parker</h4>
</div>
<div class="talk">
<h4>Wau - a constant more important than e or pi !!! - Derek Couzens</h4>
</div>
<div class="talk">
<h4>Alex Elmsley and the Hamming Code - Tony Mann</h4>
<div class="abstract">At around the same time as Richard Hamming was exploring his error-correcting codes, the mathematical magician Alex Elmsley came up with a similar idea in one of his mind-reading tricks.</div></div>
<div class="talk">
<h4>Symmetric Oddities (and Eventies) - Donald Bell</h4>
<div class="abstract">Last year, I presented my 3-4-5 Triangle Symmetry Puzzle, where an ODD number of identical ASYMMETRIC pieces can make a SYMMETRICAL shape.  Lots of people liked it.</div></div>
<div class="talk">
<h4>Big data problems - Noel-Ann Bradshaw</h4>
</div>
<div class="talk">
<h4>The Puzzle Vault - Daniel Griller</h4>
<div class="abstract">Having spent the last few years searching for and attempting to solve hundreds, if not thousands, of mathematics problems, here I propose to share a few of the gems I have unearthed. These puzzles, in my opinion, represent the standard by which all other problems should be measured. Problem composition is an art form, and as such the presentation will double as a celebration of human creativity.</div></div>
<div class="talk">
<h4>Moessner's magic - Sue de Pomerai</h4>
<div class="abstract">An interesting pattern in number theory - sadly no magic involved!</div></div>
<div class="talk">
<h4>Spirolaterals, maybe with a bit of time travel - Gina Worth</h4>
<div class="abstract">Spirolaterals are nice little doodles which throw up some maths/patterns. As for time travel I wanted to show a little of what I read on it for my dissertation in 1998 and to find out if anyone has an update on it.</div></div>
<div class="talk">
<h4>Let epsilon be 1 - Paul Walter</h4>
<div class="abstract">What happens if you don't believe in real numbers and still try to do calculus and how can you explain integration to 12-year olds.</div></div>
<div class="talk">
<h4>Arithmetic for the (three-fingered) mathematician - Robert Low</h4>
<div class="abstract">We all learn to do arithmetic in base ten because that's the norm. Many of us learn to do arithmetic in base two because that's how computers do it. Fortunately, there's an alternative which is better than both, and that's what I want to talk about.</div></div>
<div class="talk">
<h4>Lattice Labyrinth Tessellations - David Mitchell</h4>
<div class="abstract">Lattice labyrinths are a family of infinite families of highly symmetrical monohedral tesselations set out on the square lattice. The bewildering shapes of the polyomino tiles belie the elegant simplicity of their construction. I can generate an LL tessellation for most (sorry, Cantor, I mean "many") number pairs (d,m) where, for instance, d can be the day and m the month of your birthday or mathematics jamboree, while the study of number pairs can lead us into some fun "elementary" (they all say that, but it is) number theory employing the complex plane. As for polyiamonds, that's another story.</div></div>
<div class="talk">
<h4>Singular Value Decomposition - Michael Borcherds</h4>
<div class="abstract">The story of how Singular Value Decomposition keeps popping up in problems I'm trying to solve</div></div>
<div class="talk">

</div>
<div class="talk">
<h4>Dactylonomy in 7 ways - Tiago</h4>
