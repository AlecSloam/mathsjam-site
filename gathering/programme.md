Please note, talks will be strictly limited to five minutes. Projectors will be available if you wish to bring Powerpoint/Keynote/Beamer/PDF/Google slides (we suggest only a few slides if you want to keep to time!) and can be presented from your own laptop or we can provide one - please bring your slides on a USB drive (ideally named with your name, not just 'MathsJam slides'!) if you wish to use ours.

## More Information
The MathsJam gathering takes place on a weekend in November, at Yarnfield Park, near Stone, Staffordshire. Sessions take place on Saturday afternoon and evening, when we have an informal conference dinner, and then continue on Sunday morning, finishing in the afternoon. Some delegates arrive earlier and stay longer afterwards. Each session will consist of 5 minute talks, interspersed with breaks for tea, coffee, discussion and networking. And playing with things.

The nearest train station is Stone, which is a ten minute taxi ride from the venue, and is serviced by local trains from Stoke-on-Trent and Stafford. We usually run a system of lifts from the station for conference attendees, for those travelling by train. If driving, the venue is roughly fifteen minutes from the M6 - use Junction 14 when coming from the South, and Junction 15 when coming from the North. Other routes are possible.

The venue is Yarnfield Park, which is a large conference centre reasonably far from any large town. The venue is fully wheelchair accessible, and the conference room is filled with large round tables. Food is served in the canteen downstairs, and there is also a bar in the building. The accommodation is on site within the complex, on three wheelchair accessible floors in several blocks. Rooms are ensuite and within a few minutes' walk of the main room at most.

The full price of the conference remains unchanged from last year, &pound;165 (single)/ &pound;250 (double) with a 10% discount for early booking, 10% discount for the unwaged, and 20% for both. Single day registration is also be available.  Early-bird registration has now closed, but other discounts are still available.

Rooms are also available to book for the Friday night and Sunday night. The rate is £50 for single occupancy, £55 for double occupancy (note that these have changed) including breakfast. Rooms must be booked directly with the venue, but mention MathsJam when you book and you can make sure you get the same room throughout your stay. The kitchens are not usually open on a Sunday night, but there will, at a minimum, be soup and sandwiches available from the bar.

## Volunteering to help
There are various aspects of the weekend for which volunteer help is needed and appreciated - offering lifts to/from the station, fetching coffee for the speakers in the breaks so they can stay and take questions, tweeting from the @MathsJam account, updating the website with new talks through GitHub, wrangling the tech, running the competitions and MCing the sessions. If you're interested in volunteering, add your details to the appropriate part of the collaborative document (you should have been emailed the link if you're registered) or email [volunteer@mathsjam.com](mailto:volunteer@mathsjam.com).

We also run several additional events during the weekend, details of which can be found on the [Extras page]({{site.url}}/gathering/extras).
