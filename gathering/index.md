The MathsJam Gatherings are events taking place in central England and New Zealand (Oceania), gathering together maths enthusiasts, monthly MathsJam attendees and organisers, and anyone else who wants to join us. We have people of all ages, backgrounds, education and ability. All you need is an interest in and enthusiasm for maths of all types.
