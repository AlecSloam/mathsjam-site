### A NOTE FROM COLIN WRIGHT

This is effectively a private party being organised by me. I promise I'll treat you fairly, and ask that you do the same. I promise that if you send me money then either the event will run and you'll have a place, or I'll give you your money back.

If you pay and then cancel, I will refund your money if you give me a sensible amount of notice. I will do my best to treat you fairly.

If you don't trust me, don't send me your money!
