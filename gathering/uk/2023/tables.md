title: MathsJam Gathering 2023 - Saturday Night Tables
---

For the Saturday evening session at MathsJam, attendees are running activities on tables in the Gathering main room. Some of them have sent through information so remote attendees can also participate - details are below. Don't forget there's also a board games table and a craft table to meet up with other Jammers during the evening in Gather.town!

### Your local maths history - Peter Rowlett, Tom Briggs and Katie Steckles

David Singmaster compiled a Mathematical Gazetteer of the British Isles for the British Society for the History of Mathematics, now available [on the MacTutor website](https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Gaz/).

We invite participants to explore the map and find out about the history of maths connections to places they live, work or otherwise know.

A group of us are forming a little working group to research local history connections and update the Gazetteer with our findings. If you know anything about your local history and would like to be involved or could give us some pointers, please let us know! Contact Peter on [p.rowlett@shu.ac.uk](mailto:p.rowlett@shu.ac.uk).

### Mathematical Model Building - Donald Bell

Donald is bringing along some geometrical building toys, including Magformers and Zometool. There will also be materials for making star polygons from stir sticks/lollipop sticks/tongue depressors - if you can get hold of some, you can make your own star polygons using Donald's [instructions](Donald_Bell-Stars_Instructions.docx) and [leaflet](Donald_Bell-Stars_Leaflet.docx).
