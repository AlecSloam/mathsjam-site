### Your local maths history - Peter Rowlett, Tom Briggs and Katie Steckles

David Singmaster compiled a Mathematical Gazetteer of the British Isles for the British Society for the History of Mathematics, now available [on the MacTutor website](https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Gaz/).

We invite participants to explore the map and find out about the history of maths connections to places they live, work or otherwise know.

A group of us are forming a little working group to research local history connections and update the Gazetteer with our findings. If you know anything about your local history and would like to be involved or could give us some pointers, please let us know! Contact Peter on [p.rowlett@shu.ac.uk](mailto:p.rowlett@shu.ac.uk).

### Mathematical Model Building - Donald Bell

Donald is bringing along geometrical building tools including Magformers and Zome tool. There will also be materials for making start polygons from stir sticks - if you can get hold of some from a cafe, you can make your own using Donald's [instructions](Donald_Bell-Stars_Instructions.docx) and [leaflet](Donald_Bell-Stars_Leaflet.docx).
