title: Saturday Night Tables

On Saturday evening a section of the room will be set up with tables, each containing an activity. Activities can range from 'Let's play game X' through to 'I will teach you how to Y', and previous years have included learning how to play Go, playing games of Set, making things with origami, learning to spin/knit/crochet, and more.

**Running a table**

Tables are run by MathsJam attendees. Full information on how to submit a table proposal will be given when you buy your ticket, but the following might be useful to know:

- you must be prepared to stay at your table for the whole of a pre-specified hour of the evening (starting after dinner)
- activities may continue after the end of the hour, but there's no obligation to continue after this time
- you'll need to bring instructions, equipment and materials for attendees to learn a new thing, make something or do something fun
- you'll get a one-minute talk slot during the day in a special lightning session to explain/advertise your activity.
