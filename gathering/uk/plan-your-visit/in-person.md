## Venue

![Yarnfield Park. A large complex surrounded by countryside.](../../images/yarnfield-park.jpeg)

The venue for the UK MathsJam Gathering is [Yarnfield Park](https://www.yarnfieldpark.com/), which is a large conference centre in central England. Yarnfield has two floors, and the main room we use for MathsJam is on the first floor - the Knighton Suite, which is a large conference room filled with round tables, and a stage at the front with screens.

This [tour video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQNhWZAWJqg&t=2s) shows various parts of the venue, and while it doesn't include the Knighton Suite, it's a larger version of the Howden Suite shown at 1:04. For a rough idea of the venue layout, our [Virtual Yarnfield gather.town space](https://app.gather.town/app/MTCdhLpepRbaogJV/virtual-yarnfield) mimics the arrangement of rooms.

A range of food is served in the restaurant downstairs, and there is also a bar, and a small onsite Costa coffee shop (open on Friday until 10pm but closed on the weekend).

The venue is fully wheelchair accessible, with lifts to the first floor and double doorways into all the main areas we will use.

## Getting There

Full and up-to-date travel information for Yarnfield is available on the [Yarnfield webite](https://www.yarnfieldpark.com/contact/location-and-travel). Driving is the easiest way to arrive, and there is a large car park onsite.

The nearest train stations are [Stoke-on-Trent](https://www.nationalrail.co.uk/stations/stoke-on-trent/) (10 miles away), which is on some major train routes, and [Stone](https://www.nationalrail.co.uk/stations/stone-staffs/) (3 miles away), a smaller local station which is closer but less frequently served by trains. Both options will require a taxi or other transport to Yarnfield, and while they're usually available on the taxi rank at Stoke-on-Trent, taxis from Stone will need to be pre-booked.

MathsJam attendees also organise a voluntary **shuttle service** for people arriving on trains, giving them lifts in private cars to and from the venue - information about this will be circulated to people who have booked close to the event.

## Accommodation info

Rooms are all en-suite, and within a few minutes' walk of the main building, via a covered walkway.

## Accessibility

The venue and accommodation are all fully wheelchair accessible, with lifts to the first floor and double doors to all of the main areas we're using. The rooms for the MathsJam Jam (on Sunday evening) and Quiet Room have a single door, but it is wide enough to accommodate a wheelchair. Accessible accommodation is available on request - please indicate on your booking if you need this, and we can pass this on to the venue.

There will be a designated Quiet Room during the event, with armchairs and tables, for people to spend time away from the main event. There are unisex accessible toilets on both floors of the conference venue.

In the Knighton Suite, where we hold our main sessions, an induction loop system is available for hearing aids, and the contents of the main display screens (two large projectors at the front) are repeated on smaller screens further back in the room.

Assistance dogs are welcome at Yarnfield, and there are designated car parking spaces within the main car park for Blue Badge holders. For more information, see [Yarnfield's accessibility information page](https://www.yarnfieldpark.com/about/accessibility)
