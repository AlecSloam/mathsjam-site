Tickets for the MathsJam Gathering include sessions on the Saturday and Sunday, as well as lunches on both days, dinner on Saturday and overnight accommodation onsite for Saturday night.

The cost of a **full weekend ticket** is **£180** (single occupancy) or **£145** (per person, sharing a double or twin room). You may share with a specified person - on the same or a separate booking - or you can tell us your sharing preferences, and we can try to match you up with a suitable roommate.

**Non-residential tickets**, covering the daytime sessions and meals, but not including overnight accommodation, are available at **£80** for the whole weekend.

**Remote attendance tickets** are available for **£20**, and include online access to the livestream of the event, access to the [Virtual Yarnfield gather.town space](https://app.gather.town/app/MTCdhLpepRbaogJV/virtual-yarnfield) during the weekend of the event, and any other parts of the event we're able to make accessible remotely. For more information, see the [remote attendance page]({{site.url}}/gathering/uk/plan-your-visit/remote).

On all Gathering tickets, there are discounts of **10% for early-bird booking**, which is valid until 15th August using the code 'early-bird', and **10% for unwaged or low-income participants**, using the code 'unwaged'. 

Additional nights of accommodation (for Friday and Sunday night) may be added to your booking, at a cost of £75 (single occupancy) or £55 (per person sharing). An additional meal (dinner on Friday or Sunday evening) may be added for £10. Discounts are not available on these additional nights/meals.
