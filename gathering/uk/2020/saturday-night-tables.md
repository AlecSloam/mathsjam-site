Hannah Gray<br />
I have a subscription to <a href="http://www.boardgamearena.com">Board Game Arena</a>, which enables us to play board games online e.g. Love Letter, Tokaido, Battle Sheep (very popular with my friends), 6 Nimmt! Choice of game depends on how many people are participating. You just need a free account on the website, and I'll explain the website and games.</li>
<li>Table B: Mathematical Objects Roadshow</li>
<li>Table C: Jeopardy!</li>
<li>Table D: Problem Solving with Maths and Lego: The furniture factory challenge</li>
<li>Table E: D&D: Igor's Challenge</li>
<li>Table F: Fractal tic tac toe</li>
</ul>
