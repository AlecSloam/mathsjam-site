## SATURDAY

### SESSION 1a : 14:00

#### Phil Harvey : Initialistic Determinism

Phil has noticed a correlation between your surname initial being in the first part of the alphabet, and your chances of success in life, and shows some graphs indicating there might be something to the theory.

- [Phil's slides (PPT)]({{site.url}}/assets/talks/2018/PhilHarvey-InitialisticDeterminism.pptx)
- [Phil's slides (PDF)]({{site.url}}/assets/talks/2018/PhilHarvey-InitialisticDeterminism.pdf)

#### Alison Kiddle : Pastamathics

Spaghetti on toast is everybody's favourite quick and easy tea, but have you ever stopped to analyse the maths on your plate? Alison has analysed the distribution of digits in the average tin of spaghetti numbers, and created a Geogebra implementation of the process of making fusilli pasta.

- [Alison's Geogebra](https://www.geogebra.org/m/fu8m43ds)

#### Mick de Pomerai : Mass Of A Black Hole

Mick presents a short history of ideas on orbits & gravity, to introduce the maths needed to calculate the mass of Sagittarius A* from Keck telescope data (which is given out as a handout).

#### Hugh Hunt : Chain On A Cone

A thin light chain with a heavy pendant is displayed in a jeweller's shop hanging on a smooth conical stand. What is the cone angle above which the chain will slip off the stand under the weight of the pendant down the slope? Hugh demonstrates some nice physical models, and shows that the line the chain makes on the surface is actually a straight line if you cut and open the cone.

#### Claire Cohen : How Lucky Is The Bonus Ball

Claire has been running a workplace Bonus Ball raffle at work, and has studied the data - what kind of numbers are commonly picked, what are people's reasons for choosing them, and how do they compare to the actual results of the bonus ball draw.

- [Claire's slides (PPT)]({{site.url}}/assets/talks/2018/ClaireCohen-HowLuckyistheBonusBall.pptx)
- [Claire's slides (PDF)]({{site.url}}/assets/talks/2018/ClaireCohen-HowLuckyistheBonusBall.pdf)

#### Laurence O'Toole : Guessing With Lies - A Magic Trick

You may be familiar with the classic Christmas cracker trick where your volunteer picks a number, and tells you which of the cards you show contains their number. Laurence presents a twist on this, in which one of your answers has to be a lie. How does it work?

- [Laurence's slides (PDF)]({{site.url}}/assets/talks/2018/LaurenceOToole-GuessingWithLies.pdf)

#### Adam Townsend : The Coin Distribution Problem Revisited

Why do self-checkout machines give the worst change? Are they better in other countries? Using real price data from the ONS, Adam asks: would getting rid of the penny fix this problem, or is there a better, more ridiculous solution? (Of course there is, and Adam's worked out which coin we'd need to add).

### SESSION 1b : 15:10

#### Samuel Hansen : The Long Tail Of Mathematical Citations

Samuel explores how age and citation counts are related in highly cited mathematical papers, with a specific focus on the way mathematical research ages - some famous maths papers were hardly cited at all until years after they were published.

- [Samuel's slides (PDF)]({{site.url}}/assets/talks/2018/SamuelHansen-TheLongTailOfMathematicsCitations.pdf)

#### Gavan Fantom : Doing Trigonometry In Your Head While Trying To Land A Plane

There's a lot of maths involved in flying a plane. Fortunately most of it can be done on the ground, but there are some calculations that pilots do while in the air. Imagine you're on final approach, less than a minute from the runway. Can you use trigonometry to decide if it's safe to land?

#### Rob Low : A Minus Times A Minus Is A Pain

We all learn quite young that a minus times a minus is a plus, and the reason given by the teacher is all too often some variation on "Because I say so". Why should we believe it? Rob explains why.

- [Rob's slides (PDF)]({{site.url}}/assets/talks/2018/RobLow-AMinusTimesaMinusisaPain.pdf)

#### Eleanor Doman : A Needling Problem From Embroidery

Blackwork is a type of embroidery that traditionally is supposed to look the same on the front and back of the material and is usually based off geometric patterns. But what kind of patterns can we use, and can we prove mathematically that they will look the same on both sides.

- [Kevin's slides (PDF)]({{site.url}}/assets/talks/2018/KevinHouston-WherewasThatTaken.pdf)

#### Mike Frost : Piet Hein - Pirate

Mike discovered a hotel in the Netherlands had a conference suite named for Piet Hein. Why did a Dutch hotel have a room named for a Danish mathematician much revered by recreational mathematicians? It turns out, Piet Hein the mathematician and Piet Hein the pirate were two different people.

- [Mike's slides (PPTX)]({{site.url}}/assets/talks/2018/MikeFrost-PietHeinPirate.pptx)

#### Peter Rowlett : Counting Caterpillars

A robot caterpillar Peter bought for his three-year-old purports to have "endless combinations". Peter shows that it has 5023 combinations (not a completely straightforward combinatorics problem), and observes that 5023 is finite.

- [Peter's slides (PDF)]({{site.url}}/assets/talks/2018/PeterRowlett-CountingCaterpillars.pdf)

#### Tung Ken Lam : Action Modular Origami

This talk explains what action modular origami is and how it intrigues and delights. What are its origins and current developments? Briefly, action modular origami involves folding and joining paper together (without cutting or gluing) into sculptures that move or change shape. They can be put in six categories (ignoring things that you throw): sliders; flexagons; rotating rings; magic wallet models; spinners/wheels, and 3D shapeshifters.

## SUNDAY

### SESSION 2a : 09:00

#### Alistair Bird : The Four-And-A-Half Colour Theorem

The truth of the famous 4-colour theorem immediately implies that the 4½-colour theorem is also true. But how can you have half a colour? And why bother investigating a theorem when we already know the answer? Alistair shares the problem: If each country has a flag with two colours on, can you arrange the colours so that adjacent countries' flags don't share any colours?

- [Alistair's slides (PDF)]({{site.url}}/assets/talks/2018/AlistairBird-TheFourandaHalfColourTheorem.pdf)

#### Michael Gibson : A New Trick For Old Dogs

The "well known" Five-Card-Trick involves a volunteer choosing 5 cards and giving them to Magician A who looks at them and arranges them with 4 cards showing and 1 hidden. Based on this Magician B can then say what the hidden card is. Michael describes and performs a new version of this trick in which only 1 card is showing and Magician B has to say what all 4 of the hidden cards are.
