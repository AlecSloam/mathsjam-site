title: MathsJam Gathering 2023 - Saturday Night Tables
---

For the Saturday evening session at MathsJam, attendees are running activities on tables in the Gathering main room. Some of them have sent through information so remote attendees can also participate - details are below. Don't forget there's also a board games table and a craft table to meet up with other Jammers during the evening in Gather.town!

### Shogi - Adam Atkinson

Adam is bringing equipment to play the Japanese board game Shogi. Here are some useful links you can use to join in:

### Games on Chessboards - Alexander Bolton

Alex is bringing some games that should be of interest to maths fans. They all take place on chessboards (or very similar grids). For remote attendees, the games Slime Trail, Lines of Action, Murus Gallicus, Hnefatafl and Tablut can be played online for free at [iggamecenter.com](https://www.iggamecenter.com/en/).

### Drawing Hacks - Katie Steckles and Andrew Taylor

We'll be sharing our favourite tips for how to easily draw mathematical shapes and objects, and adding them to [this padlet](https://padlet.com/stecks4/mathsjam-table-drawing-hacks-9rve9b3p6v5wk2vh) (where you can also contribute your own, which we'll recreate and put up in the room). All the hacks will be collated and used as the basis for a post on [Aperiodical.com](https://aperiodical.com).
 
### Your local maths history - Peter Rowlett, Tom Briggs and Katie Steckles

David Singmaster compiled a Mathematical Gazetteer of the British Isles for the British Society for the History of Mathematics, now available [on the MacTutor website](https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Gaz/).

We invite participants to explore the map and find out about the history of maths connections to places they live, work or otherwise know.

A group of us are forming a little working group to research local history connections and update the Gazetteer with our findings. If you know anything about your local history and would like to be involved or could give us some pointers, please let us know! Contact Peter on [p.rowlett@shu.ac.uk](mailto:p.rowlett@shu.ac.uk).

### Mathematical Model Building - Donald Bell

Donald is bringing along some geometrical building toys, including Magformers and Zometool. There will also be materials for making star polygons from stir sticks/lollipop sticks/tongue depressors - if you can get hold of some, you can make your own star polygons using Donald's [instructions](Donald_Bell-Stars_Instructions.docx) and [leaflet](Donald_Bell-Stars_Leaflet.docx).

### Craft Table

Join the craft table in Gather.town - we'll try to connect you with the in-person craft table pending technology behaving itself!
