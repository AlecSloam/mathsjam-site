## SATURDAY

### SESSION 1a

#### Adam Townsend: Mathematical socks: A review
Maybe you also receive maths-themed socks for Christmas. In this walkthrough, I com-pair and rank the most popular maths for socks, and try to rev-heel who designs these in the first place... no mean feet.

 - [Article in Chalkdust Magazine on the topic](http://chalkdustmagazine.com/blog/review-mathematical-socks/)

#### Belgin Seymenoglu: Math Blaster
Belgin plays a classic mathsy game from her childhood... in 16-bit graphics! Here’s her review...

 - [Rachel's slides (PDF)]({{site.url}}/assets/talks/2019/RachelWright-Aproblemof(inadvertent)patternmaking.pdf)

#### Adam Atkinson: Roman Mathematics
Some countries are unmixed - mixed numbers don't exist, or are perceived not to exist. Adam talked about Italy as a specific example since he knows it better than the others he has heard of (France, Spain, Portugal). The talk was partly about unmixedness but mostly about how hard it is to investigate this kind of issue. If you work with people from overseas it could be useful to know that some of them may never have seen mixed numbers before.

#### Geoff Morley: Neosemimagic Tilings
A generalisation of both semimagic squares and perfect squared squares brings new challenges.

  - [Geoff's slides (PDF)]({{site.url}}/assets/talks/2019/GeoffMorley-NeosemimagicTilings.pdf)

#### Laurence O'Toole: Predicting Groupthink - A Magic Trick
Make a prediction, and deal out several number cards to the audience. Then play a simple 2-rule game, where people take turns in picking one of the remaining numbers. Afterwards, all of the choices match the original prediction in a nice way.

(I'm not sure if I'm explaining this terribly well. But I don't want to just explicitly write out the details of every single step of the trick. I have no objections if anybody wants to rewrite the above paragraph after the fact.)

### SESSION 1b

#### Tony Mann: A curious magic square trick
I recently came across this interesting variation of the 'I will construct a magic square for a given target sum' trick, due to Andi Gladwin and published as [Magic Squared](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHoZ1l3YVcg), by Vanishing Magic.

#### David Mitchell: The Brothers Fibonacci; Etiam mingens mathematicae memini!
Shyness in the gents pointed Fibonacci to his celebrated discovery. Even greater shyness leads to a generalisation of his sequence and of the algebraically expressible Golden Ratio to which the ratio of successive numbers converges. (Thanks to Nottingham MathsJam attendees for illuminating observations)

A brief demo of some Genaille-Lucas rulers - does bigger always mean better?

### SESSION 1d

#### Rob Eastaway: Jardin's Principle
Jardin's Principle states that the road to full understanding passes through three stages: simplistic, complicated and finally simple.  It's hard to get to the final stage without going through the other two first - and most of us get no further than stage 2.

#### Gavan Fantom: What if numbers could have negative digits?
Imagine if individual digits within a number could be either positive or negative. Could you use small negative digits instead of large positive ones? Could you avoid learning your times tables past five? Join me for a brief introduction to a fascinating approach to arithmetic.

#### Martin Whitworth: Sums of powers
I guess most Mathsjammers know the formula for sums of consecutive integers, and many may know the one for sums of squares, but what about higher powers? - and how is Pascal's triangle involved?

 - [Martin's slides (PPT)]({{site.url}}/assets/talks/2019/MartinWhitworth-Sumsofpowers.pptx)
 - [Martin's slides (PDF)]({{site.url}}/assets/talks/2019/MartinWhitworth-Sumsofpowers.pdf)

#### Colin Wright: 70 vs 100
We all know that if you're travelling faster it takes longer to stop, and we think we know the rules.  But do we?

 - [Ben Sparks talks about the problem on Numberphile](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3D7XYQExt0)

#### Matthew Scroggs: Why and how I wrote a LaTeX package
In early 2019, I wrote the realhats LaTeX package with Adam Townsend. This package redefines \hat to put a picture of an actual hat on a symbol instead of a ^ hat. Because why not.

#### Matt Peperell: An unexpected use for the golden ratio
It's not just pentagons and fibonacci!

#### Isabel Coelho: The Mirror Reversal Problem
I look  in the mirror. My reflection looks back at me. When I wave  my right hand, my image waves her left. When I wave  my left hand, my image waves her right. Why do mirrors reversal left and right? And, if right becomes left and left becomes right, why does not top become bottom?

 - [Isabel's slides (PDF)]({{site.url}}/assets/talks/2019/IsabelCoelho-TheMirrorReversalProblem.pdf)

#### Andrew Taylor: The Belt Trick Spinor
I saw a GIF of this lovely belt trick spinor on Twitter and wanted to understand it, so I built [my own version](https://www.shadertoy.com/view/3t2Xzy).

What's actually happening is that the central cube is always drawn upside-down, but the *axis it's rotated about* is spinning. The rotated cube in the final scene spins twice as fast as the axis — but once the axis has rotated 180º and the cube is back where it started, the space around it (and therefore the connecting belts) is stuck interpolating the other way. You need to rotate the axis another 180º to reset the whole scene, and that's where the 720º periodicity comes from.

 -[The double version](http://github.andrewt.net/glgebra/double)

#### Christian Lawson-Perfect: Baked Sudoku
You can impose on Sudoku puzzles a physical system which works surprisingly well. It has phase transitions, and when you reduce the heat it settles into a solved state!

#### Stefania Delprete: Why the music staff is not really mathematically correct?
Last year I started an in-depth course on Jazz Harmony. A lot of new concept for my ears and eyes: major and minor chords, harmonized scales, and so on. 
Even if my teacher, and impressive pianist, told me I was making my life more difficult, I needed to create my own version of the musical staff, in order to use simple Maths instead keep memorizing notes positions and combination. 
I call it 'super-penta' (the staff is called  'pentagramma' in Italian) and you can use it too!

### SESSION 2c

#### Scott Elliott: Modulating secondary waves into screw threads
Deux Nuts is a tricky bolt with two captive nuts that mysteriously twist opposite directions on the same screw thread.  How?  Scott graphically illustrates the maths of its construction. Step by step, Scott overlays sin(-2𝛩) atop the peaks of a conventional screw-thread to make an unconventional nut go the wrong way.

#### Miles Gould: Quantum computing in perspective
In quantum computers, the state of a qubit (quantum bit) can be something in-between 0 and 1 - but in what sense in-between? They're not elements of the interval \[0, 1\], but it turns out that there is a natural geometry for the state space of qubits: *complex projective space*, closely related to the mathematics of perspective drawing.

- [Zoe's video of how the trick works](https://zoelgriffiths.co.uk/index.php/2019/11/29/binary-memory-tricks/)

#### Luna Kirkby: Cursed Regular Expressions
We explore the equivalence between regular expressions and finite state machines, and discuss how to reduce any FSM into a regex, culminating in some truly cursed behemoth regular expressions based on sokoban, peg solitaire, and even juggling.
