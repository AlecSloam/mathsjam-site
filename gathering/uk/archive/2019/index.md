#### Colin Wright : 70 vs 100

We all know that if you're travelling faster it takes longer to stop, and we think we know the rules.  But do we?

- [Colin's slides (PPT)]({{site.url}}/assets/talks/2019/ColinWright-70vs100.pptx)

#### Martin Chlond : The Travelling Salesman Problem: A couple of whimsical applications (Part 2)

Completion of last years talk.

#### Gordon Hayes : How to Avoid a Hangover Using Maths

A little graph theory. This talk will probably give you a hangover instead of helping you avoid one. On the other hand, everyone loves a bit of graph theory!

- [Gordon's slides (PPT)]({{site.url}}/assets/talks/2019/GordonHayes-HowtoAvoidaHangoverUsingMaths.pptx)

#### Belgin Seymenoglu : Math Blaster

#### James Grime : S.O.X.

One of my favourite mathematical books

- [James's slides (PPT)]({{site.url}}/assets/talks/2019/JamesGrime-S.O.X..pptx)

#### Alexander Bolton : Factor Graphs and Unsupervised Joke Generation

I will introduce the concept of factor graphs and describe an application of them to joke generation.

- [Alexander's slides (PPT)]({{site.url}}/assets/talks/2019/AlexanderBolton-FactorGraphsandUnsupervisedJokeGeneration.pptx)

#### Lucy Rycroft-Smith : Ten New Maths Jokes

Most maths jokes are terrible.  It's time for some brand new ones...

- [Lucy's slides (PPT)]({{site.url}}/assets/talks/2019/LucyRycroft-Smith-TenNewMathsJokes.pptx)

#### Karen Hancock : How many ways to turn a corner?

Thoughts on the many variations of a sock heel.

- [Claire's slides (PPT)]({{site.url}}/assets/talks/2019/ClaireCohen-ExploringshapeswithCurvahedra.pptx)
#VALUE!

#### Adam Atkinson : Roman Mathematics

Some countries are "unmixed" - mixed numbers don't exist, or are perceived not to exist. Adam talked about Italy as a specific example since he knows it better than the others he has heard of (France, Spain, Portugal). The talk was partly about unmixedness but mostly about how hard it is to investigate this kind of issue. If you work with people from "overseas" it could be useful to know that some of them may never have seen mixed numbers before.

- [Adam's slides (PPT)]({{site.url}}/assets/talks/2019/AdamAtkinson-RomanMathematics.pptx)

#### Sam Hartburn : (Not) Squaring the Circle

A poetic (well, rhyming (well, mostly)) look at some shapes that can be squared using ruler and compass.

- [Sam's slides (PPT)]({{site.url}}/assets/talks/2019/SamHartburn-(Not)SquaringtheCircle.pptx)

#### Miles Gould : Quantum computing in perspective

In quantum computers, the state of a "qubit" (quantum bit) can be something in-between 0 and 1 - but in what sense "in-between"? They're not elements of the interval [0, 1], but it turns out that there is a natural geometry for the state space of qubits: *complex projective space*, closely related to the mathematics of perspective drawing.

- [Miles's slides (PPT)]({{site.url}}/assets/talks/2019/MilesGould-Quantumcomputinginperspective.pptx)

#### Matt Peperell : An unexpected use for the golden ratio

It's not just pentagons and fibonacci!

- [Matt's slides (PPT)]({{site.url}}/assets/talks/2019/MattPeperell-Anunexpecteduseforthegoldenratio.pptx)

#### Laurence O'Toole : Predicting Groupthink - A Magic Trick

Make a prediction, and deal out several number cards to the audience. Then play a simple 2-rule game, where people take turns in picking one of the remaining numbers. Afterwards, all of the choices match the original prediction in a nice way.

(I'm not sure if I'm explaining this terribly well. But I don't want to just explicitly write out the details of every single step of the trick. I have no objections if anybody wants to rewrite the above paragraph after the fact.)

#### Scott Elliott : Modulating secondary waves into screw threads

Step by step, Scott overlays ùë†ùëñùëõ(‚àí2ùõ©) atop the peaks of a conventional screw-thread to make an unconventional nut go the wrong way.
[NB: In case the UNICODE text ùë†ùëñùëõ(‚àí2ùõ©) doesn‚Äôt display correctly, replace it with 'sin( -2Œò )']

- [Scott's slides (PPT)]({{site.url}}/assets/talks/2019/ScottElliott-Modulatingsecondarywavesintoscrewthreads.pptx)"

#### David Mitchell : The Brothers Fibonacci; Etiam mingens mathematicae memini! (The Latin can be omitted from the title if exceeds max. letter count).

Shyness in the gents pointed Fibonacci to his celebrated discovery. The increasing obesity of clients leads to a generalisation of his sequence and of the algebraically expressible Golden Ratio to which the ratio of successive numbers converges. I have failed and challenge others to find a geometric interpretation of higher-order ratios. (Thanks to Nottingham MathsJam attendees for illuminating observations)

- [David's slides (PPT)]({{site.url}}/assets/talks/2019/DavidMitchell-TheBrothersFibonacci;Etiammingensmathematicaememini!(TheLatincanbeomittedfromthetitleifexceedsmax.lettercount)..pptx)

#### Geoff Morley : Neosemimagic Tilings

A generalisation of both semimagic squares and perfect squared squares brings new challenges.

- [Geoff's slides (PPT)]({{site.url}}/assets/talks/2019/GeoffMorley-NeosemimagicTilings.pptx)

#### Tony Mann : A curious magic square trick

I recently came across this interesting variation of the "I will construct a magic square for a given target sum" trick, due to Andi Gladwin and published as "Magic Squared".

- [Tony's slides (PPT)]({{site.url}}/assets/talks/2019/TonyMann-Acuriousmagicsquaretrick.pptx)

#### Peter Rowlett : #tmwyk

Can I provide this if I actually write the talk? I'm not sure how much time to invest in planning out a talk I may not give?

- [Peter's slides (PPT)]({{site.url}}/assets/talks/2019/PeterRowlett-#tmwyk.pptx)

#### Tom Briggs : Up Above the Streets and Houses

Tom knew how rainbows worked, but then realised that he didn't actually *know* how rainbows *worked*.

- [Tom's slides (PPT)]({{site.url}}/assets/talks/2019/TomBriggs-UpAbovetheStreetsandHouses.pptx)

#### Alison Eves : Florence Nightingale: the compassionate statistician

2020 is the bicentenary of Florence's birth: a great opportunity to celebrate her contribution to statistics, and their use in saving lives!

- [Alison's slides (PPT)]({{site.url}}/assets/talks/2019/AlisonEves-FlorenceNightingale:thecompassionatestatistician.pptx)

#### Hannah Gray : Escher in the Palace

A very brief introduction to Escher's work and the permanent exhibition in The Hague (my new home!).

- [Hannah's slides (PPT)]({{site.url}}/assets/talks/2019/HannahGray-EscherinthePalace.pptx)

#### Christian Lawson-Perfect : Baked Sudoku

You can impose on Sudoku puzzles a physical system which works surprisingly well. It has phase transitions, and when you reduce the heat it settles into a solved state!

- [Christian's slides (PPT)]({{site.url}}/assets/talks/2019/ChristianLawson-Perfect-BakedSudoku.pptx)

#### Hugh Hunt : Four possibilities:

1.  dimensional analysis with two examples, show that
 a/ The amount of explosive to blow up a building (dam?!) goes as the 4th power of its height
 b/ the radius of flight of a boomerang is independent of how fast you throw it
I'd demonstrate the latter, not the former

2.  keeping water in a cup
Proving (graphically) that a cup full to the brim with water sitting on (not glued to) a plate on a string can be swung around your head in any fashion (not just in a vertical circle) without spilling a drop.
With live demo.

3.  Nodes of vibration of a bending beam
      with a beautiful - and musical - demo
    and how this helps if you have a noisy washing machine

4.  Proof that \int_0^\infty sin(x) dx = 1
           and \int_0^\infty cos(x) dx = 0
     done using simple A-level maths
           And why it matters!


- [Hugh's slides (PPT)]({{site.url}}/assets/talks/2019/HughHunt-Fourpossibilities:.pptx)

#### Alaric Stephen : Rational Origami

Starting with a unit square of paper, how can we fold it to divide a side into a ratio of 1:2? How about 3:4? In this talk we will explore a method for producing any rational ratio using a minimal number of folds.

- [Alaric's slides (PPT)]({{site.url}}/assets/talks/2019/AlaricStephen-RationalOrigami.pptx)

#### Zoe Griffiths  : Two thousand and nineteen

This talk is a look at key mathematical events of the year, with a twist. 

- [Zoe's slides (PPT)]({{site.url}}/assets/talks/2019/ZoeGriffiths-Twothousandandnineteen.pptx)

#### Eva Lesny : How many are in a few?

How many are in a few and how much is a handful? 

- [Eva's slides (PPT)]({{site.url}}/assets/talks/2019/EvaLesny-Howmanyareinafew?.pptx)

#### Mark Fisher : Mersenne and Cole 

Cole found the factors of 2^67 - 1, after Mersenne had claimed it was prime

- [Mark's slides (PPT)]({{site.url}}/assets/talks/2019/MarkFisher-MersenneandCole.pptx)

#### Martin Whitworth : Sums of powers

I guess most Mathsjammers know the formula for sums of consecutive integers, and many may know the one for sums of squares, but what about higher powers? - and how is Pascal's triangle involved?

- [Martin's slides (PPT)]({{site.url}}/assets/talks/2019/MartinWhitworth-Sumsofpowers.pptx)

#### Sydney Weaver : Permutations of the Cube

Discussing approaches to calculating the permutations of a rubik's cube and other twisty puzzles. 

- [Sydney's slides (PPT)]({{site.url}}/assets/talks/2019/SydneyWeaver-PermutationsoftheCube.pptx)

#### Tom Button : Is the mathematical mind flat?

Do we solve mathematical problems subconsciously or is this just a myth?

- [Tom's slides (PPT)]({{site.url}}/assets/talks/2019/TomButton-Isthemathematicalmindflat?.pptx)

#### Elaine  : Chinese Take-Away!

Discussion on several Subtraction techniques, including 'borrowing and paying back' (milk-bottle method); decomposition; invisible number line. 

- [Elaine's slides (PPT)]({{site.url}}/assets/talks/2019/Elaine-ChineseTake-Away!.pptx)

#### Gavan Fantom : What if numbers could have negative digits?

Imagine if individual digits within a number could be either positive or negative. Could you use small negative digits instead of large positive ones? Could you avoid learning your times tables past five? Join me for a brief introduction to a fascinating approach to arithmetic.

- [Gavan's slides (PPT)]({{site.url}}/assets/talks/2019/GavanFantom-Whatifnumberscouldhavenegativedigits?.pptx)

#### Stefania Delprete : Why the music staff is not really mathematically correct?

Last year I started an in-depth course on Jazz Harmony. A lot of new concept for my ears and eyes: major and minor chords, harmonized scales, and so on. 
Even if my teacher, and impressive pianist, told me I was making my life more difficult, I needed to create my own version of the musical staff, in order to use simple Maths instead keep memorizing notes positions and combination. 
I call it 'super-penta' (the staff is called  'pentagramma' in Italian) and you can use it too! 

- [Stefania's slides (PPT)]({{site.url}}/assets/talks/2019/StefaniaDelprete-Whythemusicstaffisnotreallymathematicallycorrect?.pptx)"

#### Alison Kiddle : Adventures with Dodecahedra

Dodecahedra are pretty cool! In this talk, I will share some of my favourite dodecahedral things you can make and do.

- [Alison's slides (PPT)]({{site.url}}/assets/talks/2019/AlisonKiddle-AdventureswithDodecahedra.pptx)

#### Jonathan Welton : Domino Knights and Patios

If chess pieces were domino sized, what move would the knight have? And what boards could it tour? And just what has this to do with garden design?

- [Jonathan's slides (PPT)]({{site.url}}/assets/talks/2019/JonathanWelton-DominoKnightsandPatios.pptx)

#### Rob Eastaway : Jardin's Principle

Jardin's Principle states that the road to full understanding passes through three stages: simplistic, complicated and finally simple.  It's hard to get to the final stage without going through the other two first - and most of us get no further than stage 2.

- [Rob's slides (PPT)]({{site.url}}/assets/talks/2019/RobEastaway-Jardin'sPrinciple.pptx)

#### Alistair Bird : The Bottle Imp

The Robert Louis Stevenson short story "The Bottle Imp" has an unusually mathematical set-up, with an inductive quandary like the 'unexpected hanging' or 'surprise exam' paradox. We also talk about a card game based on the story, and discuss how to behave before an apocalypse.

- [Alistair's slides (PPT)]({{site.url}}/assets/talks/2019/AlistairBird-TheBottleImp.pptx)

#### Luna Kirkby : Cursed Regular Expressions

We explore the equivalence between regular expressions and finite state machines, and discuss how to reduce any FSM into a regex, culminating in some truly cursed behemoth regular expressions based on sokoban, peg solitaire, and even juggling.

- [Luna's slides (PPT)]({{site.url}}/assets/talks/2019/LunaKirkby-CursedRegularExpressions.pptx)

#### Rachel Wright : A problem of (inadvertent) pattern making

An unexpected problem of patternmaking, and the even more unexpected use of that same characteristic...

- [Rachel's slides (PPT)]({{site.url}}/assets/talks/2019/RachelWright-Aproblemof(inadvertent)patternmaking.pptx)

#### Daniele Aurelio : The actual Library of Babel

Musings on pi, cryptic (in)finite libraries and how sticks can become books.

- [Daniele's slides (PPT)]({{site.url}}/assets/talks/2019/DanieleAurelio-TheactualLibraryofBabel.pptx)

#### Adam Townsend : Mathematical socks: A review

Maybe you also receive maths-themed socks for Christmas. In this walkthrough, I com-pair and rank the most popular maths for socks, and try to rev-heel who designs these in the first place... no mean feet.

- [Adam's slides (PPT)]({{site.url}}/assets/talks/2019/AdamTownsend-Mathematicalsocks:Areview.pptx)

#### Matthew Scroggs : Why and how I wrote a LaTeX package

In early 2019, I wrote the realhats LaTeX package with Adam Townsend. This package redefines \hat to put a picture of an actual hat on a symbol instead of a ^ hat. Because why not.

- [Matthew's slides (PPT)]({{site.url}}/assets/talks/2019/MatthewScroggs-WhyandhowIwroteaLaTeXpackage.pptx)

#### Andrew Taylor : The ""Belt Trick"" Spinor

I saw a GIF of this lovely ""belt trick"" spinor on Twitter and wanted to understand it, so I built my own version https://www.shadertoy.com/view/3t2Xzy

What's actually happening is that the central cube is always drawn upside-down, but the *axis it's rotated about* is spinning. The rotated cube in the final scene spins twice as fast as the axis ‚Äî but once the axis has rotated 180¬∫ and the cube is back where it started, the space around it (and therefore the connecting belts) is stuck interpolating the other way. You need to rotate the axis another 180¬∫ to reset the whole scene, and that's where the 720¬∫ periodicity comes from.

- [Andrew's slides (PPT)]({{site.url}}/assets/talks/2019/AndrewTaylor-The""BeltTrick""Spinor.pptx)"

#### Miguel Gon√ßalves : From a new deck to Si Stebbins 

How to prepare a Si Stebbins stack from a new deck order during a performance.

- [Miguel's slides (PPT)]({{site.url}}/assets/talks/2019/MiguelGon√ßalves-FromanewdecktoSiStebbins.pptx)

#### Isabel Coelho : The Mirror Reversal Problem

I look  in the mirror. My reflection looks back at me. When I wave  my right hand, my image waves her left. When I wave  my left hand, my image waves her right. Why do mirrors reversal left and right? And, if right becomes left and left becomes right, why does not top become bottom?

- [Isabel's slides (PPT)]({{site.url}}/assets/talks/2019/IsabelCoelho-TheMirrorReversalProblem.pptx)

#### Yuen Ng : Moving on from Napier's bones...

A brief demo of some Genaille-Lucas rulers - does bigger always mean better?

- [Yuen's slides (PPT)]({{site.url}}/assets/talks/2019/YuenNg-MovingonfromNapier'sbones....pptx)
"
#### Louise Mabbs : Circling the Square & my Mathematical Magic progressions

My first Mathematical Magic quilts were made on standard square grids. 

After discovering polar grids I wondered how it would work on a circular grid. 

My next ‚Äòwhat if‚Äô was What if I use 2 circles? Answer - the colours in my spirals flip from the inside of each ring to the outside of the ring (top heavy triangles become bottom heavy). Why? Not sure yet, but interesting effect.

What if I use 3 circles? Answer ‚Äì I end up with two clockwise and one anticlockwise (or vice versa). Why? Ah, I remember! - physics and cog principals. So to get a balanced design I had to create a wave design instead (husband suggests cosines) it‚Äôs a bit like the Isle of Mann logo ‚Äì a triskelion.

What next? What if I use four spirals? What possibilities will that provide? How many ways can I link the circular grids to one another?

In the future ‚Äì What about five circles? Or six, or seven‚Ä¶..
