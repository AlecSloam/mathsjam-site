<p>The gathering took place on 12th-13th November 2011.</p>

<h2>Saturday</h2>

<div class="talk">
	<h4>Francis Hunt - Some Mathematical Results from Physical Reasoning</h4>
	<p>From Mark Levi's book, Francis presents two interesting mechanical problems. For example, a fish tank shaped like a triangular prism, mounted to rotate around a pole at one corner. Resolve the forces?</p>

<div class="talk">
	<h4>Stella Dudzic - Cliff Top Welly Wanging</h4>
	<p>Throwing a welly is a well-known sport, and achieving the greatest distance is the aim. If standing on top of a cliff, can we increase our range, and by how much?</p>
</div>

<div class="talk">
	<h4>Tony Mann - A Textbook Problem</h4>
	<p>Tony presents a problem from the first known maths textbook - but is it a realistic, useful and correct question?</p>

	</ul>
</div>

<div class="talk">
	<h4>Yuen Ng - Cryptarithmetic Puzzles</h4>
	<p>Yuen presents Cryptarithmetic puzzles of the form SATURN + JUPITER = PLANETS, in which each letter stands for a digit from 0-9, and the sum is valid. He also informs that he has used the names of 38 MathsJam delegates to create similar puzzles - so it turns out SAMUEL + HANSEN = ANGLES, COLIN + WRIGHT= THRILL and JAMES + GRIME = CAESAR!</p>

	</ul>
</div>

<div class="talk">
	<h4>Andrew Lobb - Painting my wall</h4>
	<p>Andrew is attempting to paint his wall, using the sequences (1/3)^n and the list of fractions 1/1, 1/2, 1/3, 2/3, 1/4, 3/4, 1/5, 2/5, 3/5,... but will he ever finish?</p>
</div>

<div class="talk">
	<h4>Phil Harvey - A Partition of the first 16 integers</h4>
	<p>The puzzle is to find a partition of the numbers 1 to 16 in which each set has the same sum, the same sum of squares, and the sum of cubes. It is possible, but Phil demonstrates a lovely method working modulo 9.</p>

</div>

<div class="talk">
	<h4>6<sup>th</sup> Form College Farnborough - Maths questions to be asked at interview for different jobs</h4>
	<p>Staff and students from Farnborough 6th form college present a lovely selection of problems, each of which could be given at a job interview - but not for a job working in mathematics! For example, an ice cream vendor could be asked "If you have 5 flavours of ice cream, and one cone holds 3 scoops, how many different ice creams can you make?"</p>
	<ul>
		<li><a href="{{site.url}}/assets/talks/2011/6th%20Form%20College%20Farnborough%20-%20MathsJam%202011%20questions%20to%20ask%20at%20job%20interviews.pdf">Slides</a></li>
	</ul>
</div>

<div class="talk">
	<h4>Rob Eastaway - Pi-Thagorean triples</h4>
	<p>Rob presents a nice way to construct 3,4,5 triangles using a piece of A4 paper - and suggests how such triangles might have been named. But what does Thagorean mean?</p>
</div>

<div class="talk">
	<h4>Peter Rowlett - An Annoying Puzzle</h4>
	<p>Peter expresses his annoyance at poorly-set puzzles - ones in which assumed boundaries are crossed, without specifying that this is permitted. If you have a light bulb in a room, and outside are three switches, one of which controls the bulb, how can you tell which? If you're allowed to leave one of them on for 10 minutes to see if it makes the bulb hot, then specifying this in the question makes it too easy, and not specifying it makes the puzzle poorly defined. If we can do that, why can't we look under the door?</p>
	<ul>

	</ul>
</div>

<div class="talk">
	<h4>Noel-Ann Bradshaw - Parrondo's Paradox</h4>
	<p>A probability paradox - two games, in both of which you're on average likely to lose. But if we play either one or the other at random, you are on average likely to win! This paradox has other applications - see Peter Rowlett's talk on Unforeseen Applications.</p>
	<ul>

<div class="talk">
	<h4>Jorge Nuno Silva - Erdos latino</h4>
	<p>Latin Squares are a very old and well-known mathematical curiosity. Jorge presents a way to play a competitive game by taking turns to enter numbers until someone can't go - and suggests a way to decide the winner in the event a perfect latin square is formed. And Erdos Latino is a real board game!</p>

<div class="talk">
	<h4>Colin Graham - If you don't like a strip tease, get knotted!</h4>
	<p>Colin demonstrates the fantastic things that can be made with strips of paper. If you cut a square off a piece of A4 paper, the remaining strip can be made into a Cairo tile, with fun tessellation properties, by folding opposite corners to meet. Long thin strips of paper can be knotted or braided into regular polygons - but which ones? And can we braid 12 pentagons on the same strip so that they can be assembled into a dodecahedron?</p>

	<h4>David Percy - The Optimal Dartboard?</h4>
	<p>The arrangement of the numbers around the dartboard is carefully chosen to make the game difficult. But is it optimal? David suggests mathematical ways to create a board arrangement which alternates odd and even numbers, and makes the penalty for missing your target maximal.</p>

	<h4>Ken McKelvie - A pattern in number sequences</h4>
	<p>Ken demonstrates a pattern in multiples of the numbers 123456789 and 1234; why do certain multiples result in a number consisting of the same digits in a different order? Is it connected to the square root of the number of digits, and multiples thereof?</p>
