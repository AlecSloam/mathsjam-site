## Saturday

### Session 1a - 13:30-14:10

#### James Grime: A Difficult Dice Game

A tricky dice game for us to try!

#### Gavan Fantom: So how does your calculator do trigonometry, anyway?
There are a number of different ways to compute sines and cosines, but most of them are intensive in their use of computational resources. We take a look at an approach that can be done without multiplication or division, as found in many calculators and low power computers.

#### Jonathan Welton: The Infinite Glass Bead Game

The game of Mancala may, or may not, be more than 7,000 years old, but is certainly one of the oldest abstract board games still played. What happens if we take it's move mechanism and apply it to an infinite linear board. Is the eventual result of the game predictable, or can it continue indefinitely without ever settling into a clear pattern?

#### Kirsty Fish: Who wants to be a trillionaire?

A layperson’s guide to trillionairism and how it’s something we can all achieve. Kind of.

#### Alison Kiddle: Is that your final answer?

Sometimes, in maths and in life, questions are asked in an ambiguous way. In this talk, Alison shared some ambiguous questions and challenged us to be on the lookout for ambiguity to move towards a more understanding and compassionate world.

### Session 1b - 14:40-15:20

#### Paul Livesey: Solving a Competitive Programming Problem Using Maths
In this talk I demonstrated how [Day 10 of Advent of Code from 2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/10) can be solved programmatically in several different ways before hitting it with some maths and using [the Shoelace Formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoelace_formula) and [Pick's Theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pick%27s_theorem).

Spoilers: Using maths was quicker and easier.

#### Tiago Hirth: Culture, Language and Maths

In 2019 I missed my first ever MathsJam, the reason, an opportunity to travel to Mozambique and take part in the Congress of Mathematics Space in Portuguese Language. While there I chased traditional board games, recreational mathematics and got to investigate a little on the awe inspiring heritage Paulus Gerdes left behind.

#### Mats Vermeeren: Athletics track geometry

There are a lot of lines on a standard 400m running track, bounding the lanes and marking the start and finish of different events. The finish line is always the same straight line. The start lines are more interesting. Some of them are staggered to account for the difference in lap length depending on the lane, others are curves. What is the mathematical description of these curves? Do the same curves occur in other places?

- [Mats's slides (PDF)]({{site.url}}/assets/talks/2024/MatsVermeeren-Athleticstrackgeometry.pdf)

#### Nicole Cozens: Would you rather
The conversation on students lips for the last 10\<x\<1000 years: would you rather fight 100 duck sized horses, or 1 horse sized duck? Rather than randomly arguing, surely maths can help us come to a good conclusion.

- [Nicole's slides (PPT)]({{site.url}}/assets/talks/2024/NicoleCozens-Wouldyourather.ppt)
- [Nicole's slides (PDF)]({{site.url}}/assets/talks/2024/NicoleCozens-Wouldyourather.pdf)

#### Michael Gibson: And Ninthly
Having once made the mistake of asking for a pizza to be cut into nine pieces, with hilarious consequences, I have since considered various methods of cutting a pizza equally into ninths. I will share some of these with you in this talk (methods, that is, not slices of pizza).

### Session 1c - 15:50-16:30 

#### Peter Rowlett: 9999713179999 is prime

Primes that can be reversed to give another prime are called emirp. Concatenating a prime and an emirp, overlapping the middle digit, gets you a primemirp. Peter played around with these after Katie Steckles spoke about them in a Finite Group livestream. His playing led to some code that found new values not listed in the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences - but they are now!

- [Peter's slides (PDF)]({{site.url}}/assets/talks/2024/A%20Peter%20Rowlett%20-%209999713179999%20is%20prime.pdf)

#### Kevin Houston: Who was the Nicolson in the Crank-Nicolson method?
The Crank-Nicolson method is fundamental in the theory of numerically solving differential equations. What many users of the method find surprising is that for a method from over 70 years ago one of its authors was a woman. 

Phyllis Nicolson was a PhD student whose work was inspired during the Second World War from what was then the particularly urgent problem of understanding combustion. Her work is remarkable for its significant impact and the fact that she was working at a time when, for example, women were not allowed full membership of the University of Cambridge.  
 
In this talk I'll explain why the method is important and say something about the life of this "hidden figure" who deserves to be better known than she is.

#### Clare Wallace: Statis-skittle Analysis

Famously, Skittles claim that every packet is unique. We know that's not true - but can we say anthing more? After a year of encouraging people to count and eat their Skittles, I have some statis-skittle claims to make (and some more Skittles to eat)

- [Clare's slides (PDF)]({{site.url}}/assets/talks/2024/ClareWallace-Statis-skittleAnalysis.pdf)

#### Robin Houston & John Read: Polyhedra inspired by a Stand-up Maths video

A few months ago, Matt Parker made a video about Robin's newly-discovered single-angle polyhedron (one whose adjacent faces meet at right-angles, except on one edge), inspiring viewers to send in their own examples of single-angle polyhedra. Meanwhile, another Matt Parker video about a different shape - discovered by computer - inspired John to play around with generating polyhedra within a unit sphere using some terrible Python code.

### Session 1d - 17:00-17:45

#### Sarah Denison and Tom Button: Disrupting the 'One great man' narrative in mathematics

The ‘One great man’ theory suggests that history can be explained by the impact of great men. This is the lens through which a lot of the history of mathematics is often viewed. An alternative, more inclusive, approach is to name theorems/results with mathematical names and not after people.

- [Sarah & Tom's slides (PPT)]({{site.url}}/assets/talks/2024/A%20Sarah%20Denison%20and%20Tom%20Button%20-%20Disrupting%20the%20one%20great%20man%20narrative%20in%20mathematics.ppt)

## Sunday

### Session 2a - 9:30-10:10

#### Ayliean MacDonald: Left/Right
Only at MathsJam could you combine the very 2010s vibe of Fatman Scoop’s less well known “Left Right” with a classic (Martin Gardner?) card trick. Depending on the orientation with which you hold the corners flipping the card can either alternate left and right or remain a constant left - make one yourself!

I made a dataset containing 26 sets of coordinates, where each set has the same summary statistics but resembles a different letter of the alphabet.

- [Matthew's slides (online)](https://mscroggs.github.io/mj2024-slides/)

### Session 2b - 10:40-11:20

#### Andrew Taylor: In Defence of IEEE Floating Point Arithmetic
The way computers do arithmetic has some surprising quirks, including a value called "minus zero" and another that's not equal to itself — but as much fun as it is to dunk on this nonsense, it's all there for a reason. Honest. Let's look at how and why compromising on the normal rules of can actually make computers more useful

#### Colin Beveridge: The Search For The Holy Grail

HyperRogue is a roguelike adventure game played on a hyperbolic plane. In the "Camelot" puzzle, the player needs to find a holy grail at the centre of a 28-cell circle. It's harder than it looks. 

- [Colin's slides (online)](https://colinbeveridge.co.uk/mj2024/)

### Session 2c - 11:50-12:30

#### Tony Mann: A surprising number

Earlier this year I read about the remarkable number TREE(3).  I was astonished that I hadn't known about this amazing number before, but talking to friends I found that others didn't know about it either.  So my talk will attempt to introduce this extraordinary integer.  For further information see "Fantastic numbers" by Antonio Padilla or watch his Numberphile videos on the topic.

#### Alexander Bolton: Covering Points with Disjoint Unit Discs
How many points must be placed in the plane so that no collection of disjoint (non-overlapping) unit discs can cover them? I will show, using the probabilistic method, that 10 points can always be covered. And I will also show a set of 45 points that cannot be covered.

- [Alexander's slides (PPT)]({{site.url}}/assets/talks/2024/C%20Alexander%20Bolton%20-%20Covering%20Points%20with%20Disjoint%20Unit%20Discs.pptx)

### Session 2d - 13:30-14:30

#### Adam Townsend: Buying tomatoes in LA

How US packaging law allows for pre-packed fresh veg to be sold by both mass and volume inconsistently, specifically the use of the perplexing "dry pint"...

- [Adam's slides (PPT)]({{site.url}}/assets/talks/2024/AdamTownsend-BuyingtomatoesinLA.ppt)
- [Adam's slides (PDF)]({{site.url}}/assets/talks/2024/AdamTownsend-BuyingtomatoesinLA.pdf)

#### Matt Peperell: A peculiar property pertaining to pythagorean products
I recently learned of a property relating to Pythagorean triangles. In this talk I describe a method to generate them, and then go on to analyse them in order to surface this property

#### Ben Handley: An irrational question

Is e+pi or e×pi irrational? The question, in its obvious interpretation, is unsolved. But a cheeky logicians interpretation makes it quite straightforward: the answer is yes!

- [Ben's slides (PDF)]({{site.url}}/assets/talks/2024/C%20Ben%20Handley%20-%20An%20unsolved%20trivial%20question.pdf)

#### Miles Gould: Why our maps are getting pigeonholed

Our code (which civil engineers use to plan infrastructure like power lines) had a problem - as our customers' projects got larger and more complicated, we needed more layers of geographical features than we could represent. Thankfully, the Pigeonhole Principle came to our rescue.

#### Merry Martyn: The Titanic Birthday Problem

Have you ever thought to yourself, how many of the 2,200 passengers on the Titanic shared the same birthday? What was the most popular birthday? Was there one birthday which gave passengers increased survival odds? Unfortunately, this cannot be known as a large chunk of birthday data is missing from the passengers' records. Clearly, this is a birthday problem of titanic proportions.

Fortunately, statistics can help answer these questions - Hazzah! In fact, in medical statistics, there are many methods to predict missing data which are commonly used in clinical trial datasets. Can these techniques be applied to the Titanic Birthday Problem? Can we use this to conclude whether which a single birthday has an innate survival advantage in maritime disasters?
