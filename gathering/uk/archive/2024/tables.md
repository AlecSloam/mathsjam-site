title: MathsJam Gathering 2024 - Saturday Night Tables
---

For the Saturday evening session at MathsJam, attendees are running activities on tables in the Gathering main room. Some of them have sent through information so remote attendees can also participate - details are below. Don't forget there's also a board games table and a craft table to meet up with other Jammers during the evening in Gather.town!

### A Strange objects, and probably a traditional board game (Adam Atkinson)

There will be disconcerting objects, to examine and (optionally) enjoy, and you can bring your own favourites to share. We'll also play the Kazakhstani national board game of Togyzkumalak.

### B Circle Theorem Badge Making (Alison Kiddle)

Circle Theorems - everybody’s favourite part of GCSE Mathematics. But how do you prove them? Luckily there are some nice visual proofs that are simple enough to fit on a (circular) badge. Come along, remind yourself of the proofs, and make your very own badge so you’ll never forget how to calculate angles inside circles again.

### C Task-maths-ter 2 (Chalkdust team)

We're doing it again! Just like the TV show Taskmaster, but maths themed. We'll bring the tasks, you bring the energy.

### D Practical knot tying for geeks (Miles Gould)

Cable ties, duct tape, velcro etc are all great and useful tools to have available, but none of them beats the sheer flexibility and reusability of rope and string. But the classic presentation of knots isn’t very friendly to geeks, who want to understand what’s going on under the hood and see the connections between ideas. This activity will teach you a useful set of knots that will cover most situations, show you some tricks for modifying knots to achieve different effects, and maybe even get you designing knots from first principles.

This is not a workshop about decorative knotwork, or the mathematics of knot theory. Cordage and things-to-tie-cord-to will be provided, but feel free to bring your own if you like. For anyone joining in remotely, you'll need two 30-100cm lengths of 3-7mm cord, preferably in different colours, plus a stick/pen/karabiner to tie them around. Paracord is ideal, or shoelaces are fine.

### E Making fun mathematical origami shapes (Francis Hunt)

An opportunity to make fun mathematical origami shapes, with materials and some ideas provided.

### F Frog problems (Pedro Freitas)

In this table, we will present a collection of problems involving frogs hopping to and fro. Use the PDF below to try the puzzles for yourself!

### G Mind Games: Your Brain on Puzzles	(Liam Collins-Jones)

If there’s one thing that unites everyone at the MathsJam UK Gathering it is a love for puzzles. But why? Join Dr Liam Collins-Jones alongside some of [MathsCity Leeds](https://mathscity.co.uk)’ favourite puzzles to discuss what happens in your brain whilst completing your favourite puzzle.

### H Craft Table (Karen Hancock)

Come and craft with us. Usually fibre craft based, but all crafts welcome.

Drop spindles and fibre will be available if you would like to learn to spin.

We'll also join the Gather.town space from a laptop on the craft table, and sit at the virtual craft table there, so people can chat to those joining remotely.

### I Board Games Table

This table will not be led by anyone, but if you'd like to bring or play any board games (mathematical or otherwise!), this is a good place to do that.
