title: MathsJam Gathering 2024 - Saturday Night Tables
---

For the Saturday evening session at MathsJam, attendees are running activities on tables in the Gathering main room. Some of them have sent through information so remote attendees can also participate - details are below. Don't forget there's also a board games table and a craft table to meet up with other Jammers during the evening in Gather.town!

### Making fun mathematical origami shapes (Francis Hunt)\

###  Task-maths-ter 2 (Chalkdust team)

We're doing it again! Just like the TV show Taskmaster, but maths themed. We'll bring the tasks, you bring the energy.

### Practical knot tying for geeks (Miles Gould)

Cable ties, duct tape, velcro etc are all great and useful tools to have available, but none of them beats the sheer flexibility and reusability of rope and string. But the classic presentation of knots isn’t very friendly to geeks, who want to understand what’s going on under the hood and see the connections between ideas.

This activity will teach you a useful set of knots that will cover most situations, show you some tricks for modifying knots to achieve different effects, and maybe even get you designing knots from first principles.

This is not a workshop about decorative knotwork, or the mathematics of knot theory. Cordage and things-to-tie-cord-to will be provided, but feel free to bring your own if you like.

### Strange objects, and probably a traditional board game (Adam Atkinson)

There will be disconcerting objects, and probably at least one traditional board game like Xianq Qi.

Come and craft with us. Usually fibre craft based, but all crafts welcome.
Drop spindles and fibre will be available if you would like to learn to spin.
