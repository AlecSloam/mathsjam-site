## Saturday

### SESSION 1

#### Phil Ramsden  - Thought You Were Clever When You Lit The Fuse

You have an unlimited collection of fuses, each of which burns for one hour if lit at one end, and half an hour if lit at both ends at once. Using two fuses, can you time 3/4 of an hour? Using as many fuses as you like, can you time 5/4 of an hour? What durations can you time using your fuses, and what can't be timed in this way? And what has this got to do with the logical foundations of Mathematics?

#### Sam Hartburn  - Extreme String Art (Without the String)

You can make lovely string art by using straight lines to join equally-spaced points on a circle. But why stick to a circle? By changing the initial curve (and using a lot of lines) you can generate a plethora of beautiful designs.

#### Laurence O'Toole  - Predicting Groupthink 2 - A Magic Trick

If everybody in a group has a completely free choice of number, is the result always the same?

### SESSION 2

#### Alexander Bolton  - The Longest Chess Game?

The World Chess Federation has some rules to prevent games from going on forever. I will outline a proposal by Tom Murphy VII for the longest possible legal chess game, and show the Twitter bot that I made to celebrate this achievement.

#### Philipp Reinhard  - Disturbing Mandelbrot

We'll explore what happens if we play around with the definition of the Mandelbrot set. There will be lots of pictures and animations. And the Riemann zeta function will make an appearance.

#### Sophie Maclean  - MathsJam and Mental Health

This will be different to most talks in that it will contain no Maths. Instead I want to take this opportunity to start a conversation about mental health in Maths and thank the many members of the MathsJam community who helped me in my recovery from mental illness (CW: Mental Illness, Hospitals)

#### Gavan Fantom  - Fast Inverse Square Root

The Fast Inverse Square Root is a notorious algorithm for quickly approximating the reciprocal of a square root which is both simple and impenetrable in equal measure. Find out what it is, why it exists, and develop a mathematical intuition for why the f(...) it works.

- [Gavan's slides (PDF)]({{site.url}}/assets/talks/2021/GavanFantom-FastInverseSquareRoot.pdf)

#### Johnny Ball  - How to draw a Perfect Egg Shape using a Pentagon and Pentagram.

We have here a Pentagon with a Pentagram inside it. The Pentagram was the Symbol or badge of the Pythagorean's. It is fascinating because longer and shorter lines are always in Golden Ratio to each other. By adding just three lines to the diagram, you have all you need, with a pair of compasses, to draw a perfect Egg. With compasses, form four curves and the Perfect Egg is achieved. Test it by holding a hens egg against it and see how the curves match. So the bottom wider end of a Hen's Egg is an almost perfect semi or half sphere. Now, when a hen lays an egg, which end appears first? It is this wide semi spherical end. Ouch.

### SESSION 3

#### Katie Steckles  - A Fun Integer Sequence 

A famous integer sequence in recreational maths starts 1, 11, 21, 1211, 111221, ... Katie will talk about this sequence, set some related puzzles, and explain why she's recently been inspired to talk about it.

- [Katie's slides (photo)]({{site.url}}/assets/talks/2021/KatieSteckles-AFunIntegerSequence.pdf)

#### Goran Newsum  - Quadrilateral is a misnomer

Why do most shape names follow a pattern apart but four and three sided shapes don't?

- [Goran's slides (PDF)]({{site.url}}/assets/talks/2021/GoranNewsum-Quadrilateralisamisnomer.pdf)
- [Goran's slides (PPT)]({{site.url}}/assets/talks/2021/GoranNewsum-Quadrilateralisamisnomer.pptx)

#### Nancy Blachman  - COVID Misinformation Spreads because Many Don’t Understand Maths

Until recently, the general public could get by without understanding probability and statistics. But that changed with COVID-19. Now hundreds of thousands of people haven’t gotten vaccinated and are dying because they don’t understand what they hear or read and social media spreads misinformation rapidly.

#### Alexandre Muñiz  - Shaker Dice and Edge Labelings

Shaker dice have a channel where balls fall, and numbers on the channel can be read off to determine the result. Finding useful numberings takes us into graph edge labeling.

#### Simon Bexfield - 3D printed objects

A demonstration of some 3D printed mathematical shapes, including a Menger sponge and dissections of polyhedra.

#### Richard Boland  - Generalized Pentagonal Number Theorem

Richard was unable to deliver his talk due to connection issues, but the blurb and slides are below.

A generalization of Euler's pentagonal number theorem defines a modular structure over partitions which extends naturally to overpartitions and higher order 'more-overpartitions' functions for which a combinatorial explanation is an open problem.  A triangle for partitions/overpartitions isomorphic to Pascal's triangle is presented and for which sums of coefficients on lines of a given slope provide a one-to-one correspondence between the mod-restricted partitions and mod-restricted Fibonacci numbers.

## SUNDAY

### SESSION 4

#### Christian Lawson-Perfect  - Each Edge Peach Pear Plum

I've made another baby, so it's time for another talk about baby maths. Each Peach Pear Plum is a classic picture book for babies, with a beautifully simple rhyming scheme. But I've always wished it was more complete. Join me for an Eulerian tour through fantasy land! 

- [Christian's slides (online)](https://somethingorotherwhatever.com/each-edge-peach-pear-plum-mathsjam-2021/)

#### Belgin Seymenoglu  - Zoombinis

Belgin plays the remake of a 90s game that teaches mathematical thinking without any equations.

#### James Arthur  - Running Around in Circles

Every week I run an event called parkrun, we go around and around in circles and everytime somebody shouts out how many laps we have done. Any loop can have a similar mapping to numbers. Let's explore this briefly.

#### Matt Peperell  - A set of strange notation systems for sequences of permutations

A certain subset of people, who may or may not be mathematicians, care about permutations and sequences thereof. How can we describe these, and how can we easily commit them to memory?

- [Matt's slides (PPT)]({{site.url}}/assets/talks/2021/MattPeperell-Asetofstrangenotationsystemsforsequencesofpermutations.pptx)

#### Adam Atkinson  - Is (one of the) biggest always best?

My victims in Pisa often make life needlessly hard for themselves. Multiple times, they have decided that a straightforwardish problem is actually an unsolved problem from a Richard Guy book. I will talk about the unsolved problem.

- [Adam's slides (PDF)]({{site.url}}/assets/talks/2021/AdamAtkinson-Is(oneofthe)biggestalwaysbest?.pdf)

#### Daniel Santos  - The Sun Numerical System

This talk is going to introduce you to some concepts of numerical systems and Daniel is going to talk how some of the features of the Decimal system give confusion and misunderstandings and complexity in Daniel's point of view. A new numerical system without this problems is going to be explained and introduced by the name of Sun Numerical System (or Neonal).

My employer has just started running some maths clubs for year 8 students. So this talk will just tell or remind you what trihexaflexagons and hexaflexagons are and how to make them, and note the 3 most common problems school students encounter when making them; also your welcome to the slides and templates (pdf/LaTeX) I used.
