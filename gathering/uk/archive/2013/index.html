    <h4>Every 823 years - Andrew Taylor</h4>
    <p>Every so often, a meme goes round about the date being interesting -- 11/12/13 14:15:16 or whatever. It looks impressive, but it usually annoys me by claiming it "won't happen again for 823 years" when in fact there are so many date formats and 'interesting' strings of numbers that I figured it would effectively happen all the time. So I tried to demonstrate it using Twitter, Python and the OEIS, and if anything, it worked *too* well...</p>

<div class="talk">
    <h4>Why John Buridan should be remembered for more than cruelty to animals - Tony Mann</h4>
    <p>Until very recently I knew very little about the fourteenth-century philosopher John (or Jean) Buridan.  I'm now astonished that nobody told me about his mathematical ideas and I want to share my new enthusiasm.</p>

    <h4>No-one quite knows if we're ripping you off - Adam Atkinson</h4>

</div>

<h3>Session 2</h3>

<div class="talk">
    <h4>Betting for the same team - Alistair Bird</h4>
    <p>Many people love to gamble with each other. Unfortunately, sometimes people agree, especially with their friends. Here's one possible way of betting against another person when you both believe in the same outcome.</p>

</div>

<div class="talk">
    <h4>Biased coins - Michael Gibson</h4>
    <p>A coin is tossed once and the result is heads.  What is the probability that next time this coin is tossed the result is heads again?  Clearly if the coin is fair, the answer is ½, but what if we know the coin could be biased?</p>

</div>

<div class="talk">
    <h4>Chess and mathematics - John Foley</h4>
    <p>The corner attack puzzle combines chess and mathematics. Although outwardly simple and easy to solve, it contains hidden depth. There is a piece in each corner of the board. There is a number in each corner which represents the number of times that the corner is attacked by the pieces in the other corners. The puzzle is to find out what the pieces are.</p>

<div class="talk">
    <h4>The 2½ mile talk - Ewan Leeming</h4>
    <p>The sport of Navigational Rallying is somewhat akin to trying to solve a sudoku on a roller-coaster.  I will introduce it and show how it lends itself to an interesting selection of problem-solving activities for all ages and abilities, and also to activities suitable for Maths and Geography classrooms.</p>

<div class="talk">
    <h4>Fun with 2D glasses - Michael Gibson</h4>
    <p>2D glasses, yes you read correctly, 2D glasses - not 3D glasses, which are very old-hat.  2D glasses are easy to make by cutting pairs of 3D glasses in half and joining together pieces of the same colour.  By making graph paper with 2 different types of scale, each printed in a different colour, it is possible to plot some data just once, but view it from 2 different points of view, depending on what colour glasses you view it through.</p>

    <p>An Easy Paper folding Exercise - 'The Triangle on the hypotenuse'</p>
</div>

<div class="talk">
    <h4>Quarto games of different sizes - Peter Rowlett</h4>
    <p>We have a game called Quarto, which uses pieces with four different properties (colour, shape, etc.) and the object is to place four-in-a-row sharing one of the properties on a 4x4 board. Talking about noughts and crosses, we tried to simplify Quarto using a 3x3 setup and found this was impossible. I would like to describe Quarto and the (simple) maths behind which sizes of game do and don't work.</p>
</div>

<div class="talk">

<div class="talk">
    <h4>Botanica Mathematica - Julia Collins</h4>
    <p>I will describe a maths/textiles project I've been running this year with Madeleine Shepherd, called Botanica Mathematica.

</div>

<div class="talk">
    <h4>Matt almost understands Bitcoin - Matt Parker</h4>

    <h4>Hyperbolic knots - Nicholas Jackson</h4>
    <p>There are three types of two-dimensional geometry: Euclidean, spherical and hyperbolic. In three dimensions there are eight.  The (three-dimensional) space around a knot has a canonical geometry - in almost all cases this is hyperbolic, and tells us useful information about the knot.</p>

<div class="talk">
    <h4>Bijections - Colin Wright</h4>
    <p>People often say with infinite sets that |A| ≥ |B|, and that |B| ≥ |A|, and then take it for granted that |A| = |B|.  Is this actually true?</p>
</div>

<h3>Session 2</h3>

<div class="talk">
    <h4><em>k</em> more things to do with a square (chessboard) - Alison Kiddle</h4>
    <p>Last year, I shared n things to do on squared paper, where n=5. This year, instead of squared paper, I will share k things to do with a chessboard, where k=the number I can get through in five minutes!</p>

<div class="talk">
    <h4>"There are two X, but at least one is Y" - Rob Eastaway</h4>
    <p>The problem with so-called probability questions like the "Tuesday Boy Problem", and indeed "The Thursday Girl Problem" is that they depend on who poses the problem. I've been investigating who it is that says things like "I have two of X, one of which is a Y."</p>

	<h4>Picture-hanging puzzle - Ross Atkins</h4>
    <p>Borromean has asked his cunning butler to hang a picture-frame on the wall. For extra security, Borromean requests that the hanging cord be entangled over two nails in the wall instead of one. Borromean's bad butler must do as his master requests, but would very much like to increase the probability that this picture falls. Can you find a way to entangle a cord over two nails, such that if either nail is removed, then the picture is not held up by the other one?</p>
