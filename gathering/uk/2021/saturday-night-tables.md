### Keynote Room: MathsJam Jam (Sam Hartburn)

Sing along to popular songs that have been rewritten with mathematical lyrics. This will start at 9pm to allow people to do table activities first.

### Location TBC: Jeopardy! (Matthew Scroggs &amp; Adam Townsend)

We will run a mathematical version of the gameshow Jeopardy, with multiple rounds so multiple sets of people can join in. This will start at 8:30 to allow people to do table activities first.
  
### Table A: Story exchange table (Adam Atkinson)

I'm looking to improve my and possibly other people's collections of stories of the calibre of the barometer story, the right angle proof, "heavy boots" and "other cheeses". Life-altering stuff. And not necessarily in a good way.</li>
  
### Table B: Modular origami (Kathryn Taylor)

Make exciting things with Sonobe modules. MathsJam wouldn't be MathsJam without an origami table! You'll need to bring paper - squares are best but A4 will do.
  
### Table C: Countdown (Goran Newsum)

I can set up a game of countdown. Set up will be similar to when I've streamed on my youtube channel. Bring pen and paper.
  
### Table D: Craft Table (Karen Hancock)

 Bring your own craft - come and sit, knit, sew, crochet, spin, colour, craft!
  
### Table E: Board Games

Find others who would like to play online board games. You can use <a href="http://boardgamearena.com">boardgamearena.com</a> by registering for a free account, or whatever works! There is no nominated organiser for this table, so you'll have to coordinate between whoever turns up.
