### Location TBC: Jeopardy!<br />
<b>Matthew Scroggs &amp; Adam Townsend</b>

We will run a mathematical version of the gameshow Jeopardy, with multiple rounds so multiple sets of people can join in. This will start at 8:30 to allow people to do table activities first.
  
### Table A: Story exchange table<br />
<b>Adam Atkinson</b>

I'm looking to improve my and possibly other people's collections of stories of the calibre of the barometer story, the right angle proof, "heavy boots" and "other cheeses". Life-altering stuff. And not necessarily in a good way.</li>
  
### Table B: Modular origami<br />
<b>Kathryn Taylor</b>

Make exciting things with Sonobe modules. MathsJam wouldn't be MathsJam without an origami table!
  
### Table C: Countdown<br />
<b>Goran Newsum</b>

I can set up a game of countdown. Set up will be similar to when I've streamed on my youtube channel. Bring pen and paper.
  
### Table D: Craft Table<br />
<b>Karen Hancock</b>

 Bring your own craft - come and sit, knit, sew, crochet, spin, colour, craft!
  
### Table E: Board Games

Find others who would like to play online board games. You can use <a href="http://boardgamearena.com">boardgamearena.com</a> by registering for a free account, or whatever works! There is no nominated organiser for this table, so you'll have to coordinate between whoever turns up.
