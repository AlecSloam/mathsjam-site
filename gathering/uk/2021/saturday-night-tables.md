<ul>
<li><h3>Location TBC: Jeopardy!</h3>
<b>Matthew Scroggs &amp; Adam Townsend</b><br />
We will run a mathematical version of the gameshow Jeopardy, with multiple rounds so multiple sets of people can join in. This will start at 8:30 to allow people to do table activities first.</li>
  
  <li><h3>Table A: Story exchange table</h3>
<b>Adam Atkinson</b><br />
I'm looking to improve my and possibly other people's collections of stories of the calibre of the barometer story, the right angle proof, "heavy boots" and "other cheeses". Life-altering stuff. And not necessarily in a good way.</li>
  
  <li><h3>Table B: Modular origami</h3>
<b>Kathryn Taylor</b><br />
Make exciting things with Sonobe modules. MathsJam wouldn't be MathsJam without an origami table!</li>
  
  <li><h3>Table C: Countdown</h3>
<b>Goran Newsum</b><br />
I can set up a game of countdown. Set up will be similar to when I've streamed on my youtube channel. Bring pen and paper. </li>
  
  <li><h3>Table D: Craft Table</h3>
<b>Karen Hancock</b><br />
 Bring your own craft - come and sit, knit, sew, crochet, spin, colour, craft!</li>
  
 <li><h3>Table E: Board Games</h3>
Find others who would like to play online board games. You can use <a href="http://boardgamearena.com">boardgamearena.com</a> by registering for a free account, or whatever works! There is no nominated organiser for this table, so you'll have to coordinate between whoever turns up.</li>
