<a href="https://www.mathsjam.com/gathering/uk/2021/table-of-stuff" target="_blank">Click here to open this page in a separate browser tab</a>. If you have anything you think people would enjoy playing with that we can add a link to here, please contact Katie or Scroggs within the Gathering.

This is a virtual table of stuff that you can "pick up" to play with. As it's all virtual, there's no need to return it when you're done!

<ul>
<li><a href="https://mscroggs.co.uk/cards" target="_blank"><b>Chalkdust Christmas cards</b>: usually these are available in exchange from this table in exchange for a donation, this year they're available online in exchange for printing & postage costs</a></li>
