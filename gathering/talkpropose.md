title: Propose a talk
---

This is where we'll include a form to allow you to propose a talk to give at the 2018 MathsJam Gathering. You will need to be registered and paid for the conference in order to propose a talk. Please do not share this link with anyone who isn't registered and paid up for the conference, as their talk will not be accepted (and you'll just create more work for us).

Talks must be five minutes or less, and this will be strictly enforced. You may use slides, demonstrations or props, as long as you don't run over the time limit. You can send through your slides ahead of time to make things easier on the day, and we'll have support for Powerpoint, Keynote and Google Slides (and anything else sensible). If your talk needs time for elaborate setup and so needs to be after a break, or you have restrictions on when you're available to speak, please indicate this below.

Not sure if you should give a talk? We would like to encourage new or inexperienced speakers, so if you have an idea for a talk but aren't sure how it will work, or whether it's suitable, or would like any other advice or guidance, we're happy to put you in touch with one of our regular attendees who can advise you. If you think this would be useful to you, please email (mailto:katie@mathsjam.com)[katie@mathsjam.com].
