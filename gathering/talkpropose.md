title: Propose a talk
---

This is where we'll include a form to allow you to propose a talk to give at the 2018 MathsJam Gathering. You will need to be registered for the conference in order to propose a talk.

Talks must be five minutes or less, and this will be strictly enforced. You may use slides, demonstrations or props, as long as you don't run over the time limit. You can send through your slides ahead of time to make things easier on the day, and we'll have support for Powerpoint, Keynote and Google Slides (and anything else that's sensible). If your talk needs time for elaborate setup and so needs to be after a break, or you have restrictions on when you're available to speak, please indicate on the form.
