The Oceania MathsJam Gathering (OMG) is a get-together for like-minded maths enthusiasts of all abilities, ages and backgrounds — regular MathsJam attendees, teachers, recreational puzzlers, and professionals (in short, anyone who enjoys maths!) — to discuss interests, share maths problems/games/insights/ideas, make connections and generally have fun in a relaxed atmosphere.

All attendees are invited to give an informal 5 minute talk about an area of interest. These are given in scheduled blocks over the weekend, interspersed with activities, and opportunities to share (maths crafts/hobbies/games/curios/areas of interest) in a more social setting. This event is a spin-off of the UK MathsJams Gathering, on our side of the world, and in our wintertime.

You can access details about the next OMG, and read the archives at the [Oceania MathsJam Gathering website](https://mathsjam.nz).
