The MathsJam website was designed and coded by [Christian Lawson-Perfect](https://somethingorotherwhatever.com)

Most of the text is by [Katie Steckles](https://katiesteckles.co.uk/).

[Matthew Scroggs](https://www.mscroggs.co.uk/) made some contributions.

Most text for each city's MathsJam is by the organisers.

The site has been designed to satisfy the WCAG 2.2 criteria at AA level.

The diagrams in the page header are inspired by [the book _Groups_, by Georges Papy](https://aperiodical.com/2016/02/maths-object-groups-by-georges-papy/).

The photo used in the header of the Annual Gathering pages was taken by Steve Kirkby, used with permission.
