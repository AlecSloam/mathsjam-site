MathsJam Shout is a monthly 'round' of puzzles, sent in by one MathsJam for others to use. It usually includes something to make, a game, and some puzzles. Here is an archive of previous MathsJam Shouts.

Please note, this is something MathsJam organisers contribute to in order to help other MathsJam organisers - it's not a free resource for teachers, or for just anyone to use. If anyone asks for a copy of MathsJam Shout, please ask them to email you so you can add them to your mailing list and send them reminders about future MathsJams, or tell them to come along to get a copy.
