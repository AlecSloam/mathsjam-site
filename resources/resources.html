Here's a blurb about MathsJam you can use to promote your event in emails:
MathsJam is a monthly opportunity for like-minded self-confessed maths enthusiasts to get together in a pub and share stuff they like. Puzzles, games, problems, or just anything they think is cool or interesting. We meet on the second to last Tuesday of every month, in the evening, simultaneously in pubs and bars around the UK (and the world!).
